warning in my book the diary of a magus i replaced two of the practices of ram
with exercises in perception learned in the days when i worked in drama although the results were strictly
speaking the same i received a severe reprimand for my teacher there may well be quicker or easier
methods that doesn't matter what matters is that the tradition remains unchanged he said
for this reason the few rituals described in breda are the same as those practiced over the
centuries by the tradition of the moon a specific tradition that requires experience and practice
practicing such rituals without guidance is dangerous inadvisable unnecessary and can greatly
hinder the spiritual search paulo coelho
prologue we used to sit until late at night in the cafe in lourdes
i was a pilgrim on the sacred road of rome and still had many more days to travel
in search of my gift she was breda o'fern and was in charge
of a certain stretch of that road on one such night i asked if she
remembered having felt especially moved when she arrived at a particular abbey that forms part of the star-shaped trail
followed by initiates in the pyrenees i've never been there she replied i was
surprised she did after all have a gift all roads lead to rome said breida using
an old proverb to tell me that gifts could be awoken anywhere i walked my road to rome in ireland
during our subsequent meetings she told me the story of her search when she finished i asked if one day i
could write it down she agreed initially but whenever we met after that
she kept raising obstacles she asked me to change the names of those involved
she wanted to know what kind of people would read the book and how they would be likely to react i've no idea
i said but i don't think that's why you're creating all these problems
you're right she said it's because it seems to me such a personal story
and i'm not sure anyone else would get much out of it that's a risk we're now going to take
together breida an anonymous text from the tradition says that in life
each person can take one of two attitudes to build or to plant the builders might take
years over their tasks but one day they finish what they're doing then they find they're hemmed in
by their own walls life loses its meaning when the building stops
then there are those who plant they endure storms and all the many vicissitudes of the seasons
and they rarely rest but unlike a building a garden never stops growing and while
it requires the gardeners constant attention it also allows life for the gardener to
be a great adventure gardeners always recognize one another because they know that in the history of
each plant lies the growth of the whole world the author

summer and autumn i want to learn about magic said the
girl the magus looked at her faded jeans t-shirt the challenging look adopted by
all shy people precisely when it's least needed i must be twice her age he thought and
despite this he knew that he had met his soul mate my name's brida
she went on forgive me for not introducing myself i've waited a long time for this moment
and i'm more nervous than i thought i would be why do you want to learn about magic he
asked so that i can find answers to some of the questions i have regarding life
so that i can learn about the occult powers and possibly how to travel back into the past and
forward into the future it wasn't the first time someone had come to the forest to ask him this
there was a time when he'd been a teacher who was known and respected by the tradition he'd taken on several pupils and
believed that the world would change if he could change those around him but he had made a mistake
and teachers of the tradition cannot make mistakes don't you think you're rather young i'm
21 said brita if i wanted to start learning ballet i'd be considered too old
the magus made a sign for her to follow him they set off together through the forest
in silence she's pretty he was thinking as the shadows cast by the trees
rapidly lengthened and shifted as the sun sank lower on the horizon
but i'm twice her age this he knew meant that he might well suffer
breda felt irritated by the silence of the man walking beside her he hadn't even deigned to respond to her
last remark the forest floor was wet and covered in fallen leaves
she too noticed the shadows changing and the rapid approach of night it would be dark soon and they didn't
have a flashlight with them i have to trust him she told herself
if i believe that he can teach me magic then i also have to believe that he can guide me through the forest
they continued walking he appeared to be wandering aimlessly from one side to the other changing
direction even when there was no obstacle in his path more than once they walked in a circle
passing the same place three or four times perhaps he's testing me she was
determined to see this experience through to the end and tried telling herself that everything that was
happening including those circular walks was perfectly normal
she had come a very long way and had hoped for more from this encounter dublin was over 90 miles away and the
buses to the village were uncomfortable and left at absurd times she'd had to get up early travel for three hours
ask the people in the village where she might find him and explain what she wanted with such a strange man
finally someone had told her in which part of the forest he could usually be found during the day
but not without first warning her that he'd already tried to seduce one of the village girls
he's an interesting man she thought to herself they were climbing now and she found
herself hoping that the sun would linger a little longer in the sky she was afraid she might slip on the
damp leaves why do you really want to learn about magic
breeda was pleased that the silence had been broken she gave him the same answer she had given before
but he wasn't satisfied perhaps you want to learn about magic because it's mysterious and secret
because it provides answers that few human beings ever manage to find in a whole lifetime
or perhaps because it evokes a romantic past said nothing she didn't know what to say
afraid to give an answer the magus might not like she rather wished he would lapse back
into his earlier silence at last they came to the top of a hill having crossed the entire forest
the ground there was rocky and bare of vegetation but at least it was less slippery and
breida could follow the magus without difficulty he sat down on the highest point and
asked brita to do the same other people have been here before said the magus
they too came to said the magus they too came to ask me to teach them
about magic but i've taught everything i needed to teach i've given back to humanity what
it gave to me now i want to be alone to climb mountains tend plants and commune with god
that's not true replied the girl what isn't true he asked surprised
you might want to commune with god but it isn't true that you want to be alone
breida regretted having spoken she had spoken on an impulse and now it was too late to correct her
mistake perhaps there were people who wanted to be alone perhaps women needed men
more than men needed women the magus however showed no sign of irritation when he
spoke again i'm going to ask you a question he said and you must be absolutely honest in
your answer if you tell me the truth i'll teach you what you ask if you lie you must never again return
to this forest breida gave a sigh of relief he was going to ask her a question
she simply had to tell the truth that was all she had always assumed that a teacher
would demand really difficult things of someone before taking them on as a pupil
let's suppose that i do start teaching you what i've learned his eyes fixed on hers let's suppose
that i start to show you the parallel universes that surround us the angels the wisdom of nature
the mysteries of the tradition of the sun and the tradition of the moon then one day you go into town to buy
some food and in the middle of the street you meet the love of your life
i wouldn't know how to recognize him she thought but decided to say nothing
this question was turning out to be more difficult than she'd imagined
he feels the same and comes over to you you fall in love with each other you
continue your studies with me during the day i teach you the wisdom of
the cosmos and at night he teaches you the wisdom of love but there comes a moment when those two
things can no longer coexist and you have to choose the magus paused
for a few seconds before he actually asked the question he felt afraid of what the girl's reply
might be her coming there that evening meant the end of a stage in both their lives
he knew this because he understood the traditions and intentions of teachers
he needed her as much as she needed him but she had to answer the question he put to her truthfully
that was the sole condition now answer this question with total honesty
he said at last screwing up his courage would you give up everything you had learned until then
all the possibilities and all the mysteries that the world of magic could offer you in order to stay with the love of your
life brita looked away around her lay the mountains and the forests
and down below the lights in the village were beginning to come on soon families would be gathering around
the table to have supper they worked hard and honestly they feared god
and they tried to help their fellow man they did all these things because they had known love
their lives had a reason they could understand everything that was going on in the universe
without ever having heard of things like the tradition of the sun and the tradition of the moon
i see no contradiction between my search and my personal happiness she said answer my question
his eyes were still fixed on hers would you give up everything for that man breeda felt a tremendous
urge to cry it wasn't so much a question it was a choice
the most difficult choice anyone would have to make in life it was something she'd already thought
about a lot there had been a time when nothing in the world was as important as herself
she'd had several boyfriends and had always believed that she loved each one only to see love vanish from one moment
to the next of all the things she'd experienced until then love had been the most
difficult just then she was in love with someone slightly older than herself
he was studying physics and had a completely different vision of the world from hers
once again she was putting her belief in love trusting her feelings but she'd been disappointed so often
before that she was no longer sure of anything nevertheless this was the great gamble
of her life she continued to avoid the magus's gaze her eyes were fixed on the village in
its twinkling lights people had been trying to understand the universe through love ever since the beginning of time
i'd give it all up she said at last the man standing before her she thought
would never understand what went on in people's hearts he was a man who knew the power and the mystery of magic but he didn't know
people his hair was grizzled his skin burned by the sun
and he had the physique of someone used to walking in the mountains he was so very attractive with eyes that
revealed a soul full of answers and he would once again be disappointed by the feelings of ordinary human beings
she was disappointed with herself too but she couldn't lie
look at me said the magus breda felt ashamed but did as he asked you told the truth
i will be your teacher darkness fell and the stars were shining
in a moonless sky it took two hours for breda to tell the stranger her life story
she tried to look for facts that would explain her interest in magic childhood visions premonitions and inner
calling but could find nothing she simply felt a need to know that was all and because of that
she had taken courses in astrology tarot and numerology those are merely languages said the
magus and they're not the only ones magic speaks all the languages of the human
heart so what is magic she asked
even in the darkness breda could sense that the magus had turned away from her he was looking up at the sky absorbed in
thought perhaps in search of an answer magic is a bridge he said it last
a bridge that allows you to walk from the visible world over into the invisible world and to
learn the lessons of both those worlds and how can i learn to cross that bridge
by discovering your own way of crossing it everyone has their own way
that's what i came here to find out there are two forms replied the magus
the tradition of the sun which teaches the secrets through space and the world that surrounds us
and the tradition of the moon which teaches through time and the things that are imprisoned in
time's memory breida had understood the tradition of the sun
was the night the trees the cold gripping her body the stars in the sky and the tradition
of the moon was that man before her now with the wisdom of the ancestors shining in his
eyes i learned the tradition of the moon said the magus
as if he could read her thoughts but i was never a teacher of that tradition
i am a teacher of the tradition of the sun teach me the tradition of the sun then
said brita feeling slightly disconcerted for she had sensed a note of tenderness in the
magus's voice i will teach you what i have learned but
the tradition of the sun has many roads one must trust in each person's ability
to teach him or herself breeda was right there was a note of
tenderness in the magus's voice far from reassuring her this frightened
her i know i'm capable of understanding the tradition of the sun
she said the magus stopped gazing up at the stars and concentrated on the young woman he
knew that she was not quite ready to learn the tradition of the sun and yet he must teach it to her some
pupils choose their teachers before our first lesson i want to remind you of one thing
he said when you find your path you must not be afraid you need to have sufficient courage to
make mistakes disappointment defeat and despair are the tools god uses to show us the way
strange tools said breida they often dissuade people from carrying on
the magus knew the reason for these tools he had already experienced both in body and soul
teach me the tradition of the sun she insisted the magus asked breida to lean back
against the rock and relax there's no need to close your eyes look
at the world around you and try to see and understand as much as you can the tradition of the sun is constantly
revealing eternal knowledge to each individual breida did as the magus told her to but
she felt he was moving much too fast this is the first and most important
lesson he said it was created by a spanish mystic who understood the meaning of faith
his name was saint john of the cross he looked at the girl's eager trusting
face in his heart he prayed she would understand what he had to teach her
she was after all his soul mate even if she didn't yet know it
even if she was still very young and fascinated by the things and the people of this world
in the darkness breda could just make out the shape of the magus going back into the forest
and disappearing among the trees to her left she was afraid of being left there alone
but tried to remain relaxed this was her first lesson and she must not show that she was nervous
he accepted me as his pupil i can't disappoint him she was pleased with herself and at the
same time surprised at how quickly it all happened not that she had ever doubted her abilities she was proud of herself
and of what had brought her there she was sure that the magus was somewhere nearby
watching her reactions to see if she was capable of learning the first lesson of magic
he had spoken of courage and so even if she felt afraid images of the snakes and scorpions that
might be living underneath that rock began to rise up from the depths of her imagination
she must be brave in a while he would return to teach her the first lesson
i'm a strong determined woman she repeated to herself under her breath
she was privileged to be there with that man whom other people either loved or feared she looked back on the evening they had
just spent together and recalled the moment when she had sensed a certain tenderness in his voice
perhaps he found me interesting perhaps he even wanted to make love with me
it wouldn't be a bad experience there was however a strange look in his eyes what an
idiotic thing to think there she was in search of something very real
a path to knowledge and suddenly she was thinking of herself as a mere woman
she tried not to think about it again and it was then that she realized how much time had
passed since the magus had left her alone she felt the beginnings of panic she had
heard contradictory views about that man some said he was the most powerful teacher they'd ever met
capable of changing the direction of the wind of piercing the clouds purely by the power of thought and breda
was as fascinated as everyone else by such prodigies other people though people on the
fringes of the world of magic who attended the same courses and classes as she did
assured her that he was a black magician and had once used his powers to destroy
a man because he had fallen in love with a man's wife and this was why even though he was a teacher he had been
condemned to wander the lonely forests perhaps solitude has made his madness
worse breida thought and again she felt the first stirrings of panic
she may have been young but she knew the harm that loneliness could do to people especially as they got older she had met
people who had lost the glow of being alive because they could no longer fight against loneliness and it ended up
becoming addicted to it they were for the most part people who believed the world to be an undignified
inglorious place and who spent their evenings and nights talking on and on about the mistakes
others had made they were people whom solitude had made into the judges of the world
whose verdicts were scattered to the four winds for whoever cared to listen perhaps the magus had gone mad with
loneliness a sudden noise nearby made her jump and her heart raced
all trace of her earlier confidence vanished she looked around nothing a wave of terror seemed to rise
up from her belly and spread through her body i must get a grip on myself she thought
but it was impossible images of snakes and scorpions and childhood ghosts began to appear before
her breda was too terrified to stay calm another image arose
that of a powerful magician who had made a pact with the devil and was offering her up as a sacrifice
where are you she cried she didn't care now what impression she made on anyone
she simply wanted to get out of there no one answered i want to get out of here help me
there was only the forest and its strange noises breeda felt so dizzy with fear she
thought she might faint but she mustn't now that she was quite sure he was nowhere around
fainting certainly wouldn't help matters she must stay in control
this thought made her aware that there was some part of her struggling to maintain control i mustn't call out she said to
herself her shouts could attract other men who lived in that forest and men who live in forests can be more
dangerous than any wild animal i have faith she started to say softly
i have faith in god faith in my guardian angel who brought me here
and who remains here with me i can't explain what he's like but i know he is near i will not dash my
foot against a stone these last words were from a psalm she had learned as a child and which she
hadn't thought about for years she had been taught the song by her grandmother who had died quite recently
as soon as she wished her grandmother could be there she immediately felt a friendly presence
she was beginning to understand that there was a big difference between danger and fear he that dwelleth in the secret
place of the most high that was how the psalm began she realized that it was all coming back
to her word for word exactly as if her grandmother were reciting it to her now
she kept reciting for some time without stopping and despite her fear she felt calmer
she had no choice either she believed in god in her guardian angel or she despaired
she felt a protective presence i need to believe in this presence
i don't know how to explain it but it exists and it will stay with me all night
because i don't know how to find my way out of here alone when she was a child she would sometimes
wake up in the middle of the night feeling terrified her father would carry her to the window
and show her the town where they lived he would talk to her about the night watchman about the milkman who would
already be out delivering the milk about the baker making their daily bread
her father was trying to drive out the monsters with which she'd filled the night and replace them with the people who
kept watch over the darkness the night is just a part of the day he
would say the night is just a part of the day therefore she could feel as safe in the
dark as she did in the light it was the dark that had made her invoke that protective presence
she must trust it and that trust was called faith no one could ever understand faith
but faith was what she was experiencing now an inexplicable immersion in blackest night it only
existed because she believed in it miracles couldn't be explained either but they existed for those who believed
in them he did say something about the first lesson she thought
suddenly realizing what was going on the protective presence was there because
she believed in it breida began to feel the fatigue of so many hours under tension
she began to relax again and with each moment that passed she felt more protected she had faith
and faith wouldn't allow the forest to be peopled again with scorpions and snakes faith would keep her guardian angel
awake and watching she leaned back against the rock again and all unknowing
fell asleep it was light when she woke and a
beautiful sun was gilding everything around her she felt a little cold her clothes were
grubby but her soul was rejoicing she had spent the whole night alone
in a forest she looked everywhere for the magus knowing that she would not find him he
must be walking in the forest somewhere trying to commune with god and perhaps wondering if the girl who'd come to see
him the previous night had sufficient courage to learn the first lesson of the tradition of the sun
i learned about the dark night she said to the now silent forest
i learned that the search for god is a dark night that faith is a dark night and that's
hardly a surprise really because for us each day is a dark night
none of us knows what might happen even the next minute and yet still we go forward
because we trust because we have faith or who knows perhaps because we just
don't see the mystery contained in the next second not that it mattered what mattered was
knowing that she had understood that every moment in life is an act of faith
that you could choose to fill it with snakes and scorpions or with a strong protecting force
that faith cannot be explained it was simply a dark night and all she had to do was to accept it
or not brita looked at her watch and saw that it was getting late
she had to catch a bus travel for three hours and think up some convincing excuse to
give her boyfriend he would never believe she had spent the whole night alone in a forest
it's a very difficult thing the tradition of the sun she shouted to the forest i have to be
my own teacher and that isn't what i was expecting she looked at the village down below
mentally traced her path back through the woods and set off first though she turned to the rock
again in a loud joyous voice she cried there's one other thing you're a very
interesting man leaning against the trunk of an old tree
the magus watched the girl vanish into the woods he had listened to her fears and heard
her cries during the night at one point he had even been tempted to go over and embrace her
to shield her from her terror saying that she didn't need this kind of challenge
now he was pleased that he hadn't and he felt proud that the girl in all her youthful confusion was his
soul mate in the center of dublin there is a book
shop that specializes in occult studies it has never advertised in newspapers or
magazines and the people who go there do so on the recommendation of others the owner is glad to have such a select
specialist clientele even so the bookshop is always full
breida had heard about it and finally managed to get the address from the person teaching the course on
astral travel she was currently attending she went there late one afternoon after work
and was delighted with the place from then on whenever she could
she would go there to look at the books but she never bought any because they were all imported and very
expensive she would leaf through them studying the designs and symbols in some of the books
and intuitively tuning in to the vibration of all that accumulated knowledge
she had grown more cautious since her experience with the magus sometimes she would bemoan to herself
the fact that she only managed to take part in things she could already understand she sensed that she was missing out on
something very important in life and that if she carried on as she was she would simply continue to repeat the
same experiences over and over and yet she didn't have the courage to change
she needed to be constantly struggling to discover her path now that she had experienced the dark
knight she knew that she didn't want to find her way through it and although she was sometimes
dissatisfied with herself she felt unable to go beyond her own limitations
books were safer the shelves contained reprints of treatises written hundreds of years ago it was an
area in which very few people dared to say anything new and in the pages of these books
occult knowledge distant and remote seem to smile at the efforts made by each
generation to uncover it apart from looking at the books breda had another important reason for going
to the shop to observe the other customers sometimes she would pretend to be reading some
respectable alchemical treatise when she was in fact scrutinizing the
men and women usually older than she who frequented the shop and who knew what they wanted and always
went to the right shelf she tried to imagine what they must be like in private
some looked very wise capable of awakening forces and powers of which mere mortals knew nothing
others appeared to be desperately trying to rediscover answers they had long ago forgotten
but without which life had no meaning she noticed too that the most regular
customers always had a word with the owner they talked about strange things such as
the phases of the moon the properties of stones and the correct pronunciation of ritual words
one afternoon breda got up sufficient courage to do the same she was on her way back from work on a
day when everything had gone well she thought she should make the most of that good luck
i know that there are secret societies she said she thought this was a good conversational opener she
knew something but the owner merely looked up from his accounts and stared at her in amazement
i was with the magus in folk said breida rather put out now and not knowing quite
how to continue he explained to me about the dark knight he told me that the path of wisdom means
not being afraid to make mistakes she noticed that the owner was listening more intently now
if the magus had bothered to teach her something she must be special
if you know that the dark knight is the path why do you need books he said it last and she knew that
mentioning the magus had not been a good idea because that isn't the way i want to
learn she said the owner looked more closely at the young woman standing before him
while she clearly had a gift it was nevertheless odd that the magus of folk should have devoted so much time to her
there must be something else she could be lying but then again she had spoken of the dark knight
you often come here he said you arrive read a few books but never buy anything
they're too expensive said breida sensing that he wanted to continue the conversation
but i've read other books and i've attended courses she told him the names of her teachers
hoping to impress him still more again things did not go quite as she expected
the owner interrupted her and went to serve another customer who wanted to know if the book he'd ordered had come in an almanac
containing the planetary positions for the next hundred years the owner examined various packages
stored underneath the counter breeda saw that the packages bore stamps from all corners of the world
she was getting more and more nervous her initial courage had vanished completely
but she had no option but to wait for the other customer to check that it was the right book pay for it receive his change and leave
only then did the owner turn to her again i don't know how to continue said brita
her eyes were beginning to fill with tears what are you good at asked the owner
going after what i believe in that was the only possible reply she had spent her life in pursuit of
what she believed in the only problem was that she believed in something different every day the owner wrote a name on the
sheet of paper on which he was doing his accounts tore off the piece he had written on and held it for a moment in his hand
i'm going to give you an address he said there was a time when people accepted magical experiences as natural
there were no priests then and no one went chasing after the secrets of the occult
brita wasn't sure whether he was referring to her or not do you know what magic is he asked
it's a bridge between the visible worlds and the invisible world the owner gave her the piece of paper on
it was a phone number and a name wicca snatched the paper from him thanked him
and left when she reached the door she turned and said i also know that magic speaks many
languages even the language of booksellers who pretend to be unhelpful but are
in fact very generous and approachable she blew him a kiss and disappeared the
bookseller paused over his accounts and stood looking at his shop the magus of folk taught her those
things he thought a gift however good wasn't reason enough
for the magus to take such an interest there must be some other motive wicca would find it out
it was time to close the shop the bookseller had noticed lately that his clientele was starting to change
it was becoming younger as the old treatises crowding his shelves predicted
things were finally beginning to return to the place from whence they came
the old building was in the center of town in a place that is now only visited by tourists in search of a
little 19th century romanticism breida had had to wait a week before
wicca would agree to see her and now she was standing outside a mysterious gray building
struggling to contain her excitement that building was exactly as she'd imagined it would be
it was just the kind of place where the type of person who visited the bookshop should live
there was no elevator she went up the stairs slowly so as not to be out of breath when she reached the floor she
wanted and when she arrived she rang the bell of the only door there
inside a dog barked then after a brief delay a slim elegant serious looking woman
opened the door i phoned earlier said brida
wicca indicated that she should come in and brita found herself in a living room entirely painted in white
and with examples of modern art everywhere with paintings on the walls and sculptures and vases on the tables
the light from outside was filtered through white curtains the room was cleverly divided into
different areas to accommodate sofas a dining table and a well-stocked library
everything was in the very best taste and reminded breida of the architecture and design magazines
she used to look at on the newsstands it must have cost a fortune she thought
wicca led brida into the vast living room into an area furnished by two italian
armchairs in leather and steel between the two chairs was a low glass table with steel
legs you're very young said wicca at last
there was little point in making her usual comment about ballerinas and so brita said nothing waiting to
hear what the woman would say next and meanwhile wondering what such a modern design was doing inside an
old building like that her romantic idea of the search for knowledge had once again been shaken
he phoned me wicca said and breida understood that she was referring to the bookseller
i came in search of a teacher i want to follow the road of magic
wicca looked at brida she clearly possessed a gift but she needed to know why the magus of
folk had been so interested in her the gift on its own was not enough if
the magus had been new to magic he might have been impressed by the clarity with which the gift manifested
itself in the young woman but he had lived long enough to know that everyone possesses a gift
he was wise to such traps she got up went over to one of the bookshelves and
picked up her favorite deck of cards do you know how to lay the cards she
asked breida nodded she had done a few courses and knew that the deck in the woman's
hand was a tarot deck with 78 cards she had learned various ways of laying out the tarot
and was glad to have a chance to show off her knowledge however the woman kept hold of the deck
she shuffled the cards then placed them face down in no particular order on the glass table
this was a method quite unlike any brita had learned in her courses the woman sat looking at them for a
moment said a few words in a strange language then turned over just one of the cards
it was card number 23 a king of clubs good protection
she said from a strong powerful man with dark hair
her boyfriend was neither strong nor powerful and the magus hair was gray don't think
about his physical appearance said wicca as if she had read her thoughts
think of your soul mate what do you mean soul breeda was surprised
the woman inspired a strange respect different from the respect she had felt for the magus or for the bookseller
wicca did not answer the question she again shuffled the cards and again spread them in that same
disorderly manner on the table except that this time the cards were face up
the card in the middle of that apparent confusion was card number eleven a woman forcing open the mouth of a lion
wicka picked up the card and asked brita to hold it breida did so although without knowing
quite what was required of her in previous incarnations your stronger
side was always a woman wicca said what do you mean by soul mate
breida asked again it was the first time she had challenged the woman but it was nonetheless a very timid
challenge wicca remained silent for a moment a suspicion crossed her mind
for some reason the magus had not taught the girl about soul mates nonsense she said to herself and brush
the thought aside the soul mate is the first thing people learn about when they want to follow the
tradition of the moon she said only by understanding the soulmate
can we understand how knowledge can be transmitted over time as wicca continued her explanation
breida remained silent feeling anxious we are eternal because we are all manifestations of god
wicca said that is why we go through many lives and many deaths emerging out of some unknown place and
going toward another equally unknown place you must get used to the fact that there are many
things in magic which are not and never will be explained god decided to do certain things in a
certain way and why he did this is a secret known only to him
the dark knight of faith thought breida so it existed in the tradition of the
moon as well the fact is that this happens wicca went on
and when people think of reincarnation they always come up against a very difficult question
if in the beginning there were so few people on the face of the earth and now there are so many where did all
those new souls come from brita held her breath she had asked
herself this question many times the answer is simple said wicca after
pausing to savor the young woman's eager silence in certain reincarnations we divide into
two our souls divide as do crystals and stars cells and plants our soul divides in two
and those new souls are in turn transformed into two and so within a few generations we are
scattered over a large part of earth and does only one of those parts know
who it is asked breida she had many questions to ask but she wanted to ask them one at a time
and this seemed the most important we form part of what the alchemists call
the anima mundi the soul of the world said wikka without replying to the
question the truth is that if the anima mundi were merely to keep dividing
it would keep growing but it would also become gradually weaker that is why as well as dividing into two
we also find ourselves and that process of finding ourselves is
called love because when a soul divides it always divides into a male part in a female
part that's how the book of genesis explains it the soul of adam was split in two
and eve was born out of him wicca stopped suddenly and sat looking
at the cards scattered on the table there are many cards she said but
they're all part of the same deck in order to understand their message we need them all all are equally important so it is with
souls human beings are all interlinked like the cards in this deck
in each life we feel a mysterious obligation to find at least one of those soulmates
the greater love that separated them feels pleased with the love that brings them together again
but how will i know who my soulmate is brita felt that this was one of the most
important questions she had ever asked in her life wicca laughed
she had already asked herself that question and with the same eager anxiety as the young woman opposite her
you could tell your soulmate by the light in their eyes and since time began that has been how
people have recognized their true love the tradition of the moon used a different process
a kind of vision that showed a point of light above the left shoulder of your soul mate but she wouldn't tell the girl that just
yet she might one day learn to see that point of light or she might not she would get her
answer soon enough by taking risks she said to breita
by risking failure disappointment disillusion but never ceasing in your search for
love as long as you keep looking you will triumph in the end breida
remembered the magus saying something similar when he spoke about the path of magic
perhaps it's all the same thing she thought wicca started picking up the cards from
the table and brita sensed that her time was nearly up yet there was one other question to ask
is it possible to meet more than one soul mate in each life yes thought wicca with a certain
bitterness and when that happens the heart is divided and the result is pain and suffering yes we can meet
three or four soul mates because we are many and we are scattered the young woman was asking the right
questions but she had to avoid answering them the essence of creation is one and one
alone she said and that essence is called love love is the force that brings us back
together in order to condense the experience dispersed in many lives and many parts of the world
we are responsible for the whole earth because we do not know where they might be
those soul mates we were from the beginning of time if they are well then we too will be
happy if they are not well we will suffer however unconsciously a portion of their pain above all though
we are responsible for re-encountering at least once in every incarnation
the soulmate who is sure to cross our path even if it is only for a matter of moments because those moments bring with
them a love so intense that it justifies the rest of our days
the dog barked in the kitchen wicca finished picking up the cards and looked again at breida
we can also allow our soulmate to pass us by without accepting him or her or even
noticing then we will need another incarnation in order to find that soulmate
and because of our selfishness we will be condemned to the worst torture humankind ever invented for itself
loneliness wicca got up and showed breda to the door
you didn't come here to find out about your soulmate she said before saying goodbye
you have a gift and once i know what that gift is i might be able to teach you the
tradition of the moon brita felt very special she needed to
feel this for the woman inspired a respect she had felt for very few other people
i'll do my best i want to learn the tradition of the moon she thought because the tradition of the
moon doesn't require you to spend the night alone in a dark forest
now listen to me said wicca sternly every day from today at an hour of your
choosing sit down alone at a table and spread the tarot deck as i did
completely at random don't try to understand anything simply study the cards they will teach
you all you need to know for the moment it's like the tradition of the sun me
teaching myself again thought breeda as she went down the stairs and only when she was on the bus
did she realize that the woman had spoken of a gift but she could talk about that at their
next meeting for a whole week breeda devoted half an
hour a day to spreading the tarot cards on the table in the living room she went to bed at 10 o'clock and set
the alarm for one in the morning she would get up make a quick cup of coffee and sit down to contemplate the
cards trying to decipher their hidden language the first night she was very excited
brita was convinced that wicca had taught her some kind of secret ritual and so she tried to spread the cards in
exactly the same way expecting some occult message to be revealed
after half an hour apart from a few minor visions which she felt were merely the fruits of her imagination
nothing of any great note had happened she did the same thing on the second night
wicca had said that the cards would tell their own story and to judge by the courses breida had
attended it was a very ancient story indeed dating back more than three thousand
years to a time when mankind was closer to the original wisdom the picture seemed so simple she thought
a woman forcing open the mouth of a lion a cart pulled by two mysterious animals a man
sitting before a table covered with sundry objects she had been taught that the deck was a
book a book in which the divine wisdom had noted down the main changes that take place
during our journey through life but its author knowing that humanity learned more easily from vice than from
virtue had arranged for this sacred book to be transmitted across the generations
in the form of a game the deck was an invention of the gods it can't be that simple thought breida
every time she spread the cards on the table she had been taught complicated methods elaborate systems
and those cards arranged in no particular order began to have a troubling effect on her reasoning
on the third night she threw the cards down angrily on the floor for a moment she thought that this angry
reaction might have some magical inspiration behind it but the results were equally
unsatisfactory just a few indefinable intuitions which again
she dismissed as mere imaginings at the same time the idea of her soulmate didn't leave
her for a moment at first she felt as if she were going back to her adolescence
to dreams of an enchanted prince crossing mountains and valleys in search of his lady of the glass
slipper or in order to awaken a sleeping beauty with a kiss
finding your soul mate is something that only happens in fairy tales she told herself half joking fairy tales
had been her first experience of the magical universe that she was now so eager to enter and
more than once she had wondered why people ended up distancing themselves from that world
knowing the immense joy that childhood had brought to their lives perhaps because they weren't content
with feeling joy she found the idea slightly absurd but
nevertheless recorded it in her diary as a creative thought after spending a week
obsessed with the idea of the soulmate breda became gripped by a terrifying feeling
what if she chose the wrong man on the eighth night when she woke again to carry out her
vain contemplation of the tarot cards she decided to invite her boyfriend out to supper the following night
she chose a fairly inexpensive restaurant because he always insisted on paying the bill despite the fact that he earned far less
as a research assistant to a physics professor at the university than she earned as a secretary it was
still summer and they sat out at one of the tables on the pavement by the river
i want to know when the spirits are going to let me sleep with you again said lauren's good humoredly brita
looked at him tenderly she had asked him not to come to her apartment for two weeks and he had agreed protesting just warmly
enough for her to know how much he loved her in his way he too was seeking to understand the mysteries of the universe
and if one day he were to ask her to stay away from him for two weeks she would have to say yes they dined
unhurriedly and largely in silence watching the boats crossing the river and the people walking past on the
pavement the bottle of white wine on the table was emptied and replaced by another
half an hour later they had pushed their two chairs together and were sitting arms around each other
gazing up at the starry summer sky just look at that sky said lauren
stroking her hair what we're looking at now is how the sky would have appeared thousands of years
ago he had told her the same thing on the day they first met but breida chose not to interrupt him
this was his way of sharing his world with her many of those stars have already died
and yet their light still fills the universe other stars were born far away and their light has not yet
reached us so no one knows what the real sky looks like
she had asked that same question on their first meeting too but it was good to repeat such delicious
moments we don't know we study what we can see but what we see is not always what
exists i want to ask you something what are we made of
where did the atoms that make up our bodies come from lawrence looked up at the ancient sky
and said they were created along with these stars and this river
in the first second of the universe's existence so after that first moment of creation
nothing more was added no nothing everything moved and continues to move
everything was transformed and continues to be transformed but all the matter that exists in the
universe now is the same matter from all those billions of years ago and not so much as
a single atom has been added breda sat studying the movement of both
river and stars it was easy to see the river flowing across the earth
but it was hard to see the stars moving in the sky and yet both were moving lauren's
she said it last after a long silence during which they both watched a boat passing
let me ask you what might seem an absurd question is it physically possible that the atoms
that make up my body could have been in the body of someone who lived before me
lauren stared at her in amazement what do you mean what i said is such a thing possible
they could be in plants or insects or they could have turned into helium molecules and be out there
somewhere millions of miles from earth but is it possible that the atoms that
made up the body of someone who died could be in my body and in someone else's body
he said nothing for a moment then said yes it is
the sound of distant music reached them it came from a barge crossing the river
and even from far away breda could make out the silhouette of a sailor framed in a lighted window
it was a tune that reminded her of her adolescence it brought back memories of school dances
the smell of her bedroom the color of the ribbon she would use to tie up her ponytail
breida realized that laurens had never before considered the question she had asked him and was perhaps at that moment wondering
if his own body contained the atoms of viking warriors or volcanic explosions or if prehistoric
animals that had mysteriously disappeared but her thoughts were elsewhere all she
wanted to know was this had the man so tenderly embracing her
once been part of herself the barge came closer and the music
began to fill the air around them conversations at the other table stopped too everyone eager to find out where the
sound was coming from because everyone had once been an adolescent attended school dances
and had dreams full of stories about warriors and fairies i love you lawrence and breda hoped
against hope that this young man who knew so much about the light from the stars
contained a little of the person she had once been
it's no good i can't do it breeda sat up in bed and felt for the packet of cigarettes on
the bedside table going against all her normal habits she decided to smoke a cigarette before
breakfast it was another two days until she was due to meet wicca again
she knew that during the last two weeks she had tried her hardest she had channeled all her hopes into the
method of spreading the cards taught to her by that attractive and mysterious woman and she had struggled hard not to
disappoint her but the cards refused to reveal their secrets each time the previous three nights when
she had finished the exercise she had felt like crying she felt vulnerable and alone
and had a sense that a great opportunity was slipping through her fingers once again she felt that life was not
treating her as it treated other people it gave her every chance to achieve something and just when she was close to
that objective the ground opened up and swallowed her that's how it had been with her studies
with certain boyfriends and with certain dreams she had never shared with anyone
she thought of the magus perhaps he could help her but she had promised herself that she
would only go back to folk when she knew enough about magic to face him again
and now it seemed that this would never happen she lay for a long time in bed before
deciding to get up and make breakfast finally she screwed up the necessary resolve and courage to face another day
one more of her daily dark nights as she had taken to calling them since her experience in the forest
she prepared some coffee looked at her watch and saw that she still had enough time
she went over to the shelf and searched among the books for the piece of paper the bookseller had given her
to console herself she thought there are other paths she had met the magus she had met wicca
and she would in the end meet the person who could teach her in a way that she could understand
but she knew this was merely an excuse i'm always starting things and then
giving up she thought rather sourly perhaps life would soon realize this
and stop presenting her with the same opportunities over and over or perhaps by always giving up when she
had only just started she had exhausted all possible paths without even taking a single step
but that was how she was and she felt herself growing gradually weaker and less and less able to change a few
years before she would have felt depressed by her own behavior but she would at least
still have been capable of the occasional heroic gesture now though she was starting to adapt to
her own mistakes she knew other people who did the same they too got used to their mistakes
and it wasn't long before they began to see them as virtues and by then it was too late she
considered not phoning wicca and simply disappearing but what about the bookshop
she wouldn't then have the courage to go there again if she just disappeared the bookseller would not be so kind next
time it's happened before because of some thoughtless gesture toward one person
i've ended up losing touch with other people i really cared about she couldn't do the same thing now she
was on a path where valuable contacts were very hard to find she steeled herself and dialed the
number on the piece of paper wicca answered i won't be able to come
tomorrow said brida no the plumber can't make it either
replied wicca for a moment brita had no idea what the woman was talking about then wicca started complaining
about some problem with her kitchen sink and how she'd arranged several times for a man to come and fix it but he never
came she launched into a long story about old buildings which might look terribly imposing but which were of
course beset by all kinds of problems then in the middle of her story about the plumber wicca suddenly asked
have you got your tarot cards handy surprised brita said that she did wicca asked her
to spread the cards on the table because she was going to teach her a method of finding out whether the plumber would or
would not turn up the following day feeling even more surprised breeda did
as she was asked she spread the cards and sat staring blankly at the table while she awaited instructions from the
other end of the line the courage to explain the reason for her phone call was gradually fading
wicca was still talking and brita decided to listen to her patiently perhaps she would become her friend
perhaps then she would be more tolerant and show her easier ways of understanding the tradition of the moon
wicca meanwhile was weaving one topic of conversation seamlessly into another
and having finished her litany of complaints about plumbers she started describing an argument she'd
had with the building manager about the caretaker's salary she then moved on to a report that she'd
read on old age pensions brita accompanied all this with a few affirmative grunts
agreeing with everything wicca was saying but no longer listening a terrible tedium took hold of her this
conversation with a woman she barely knew regarding plumbers caretakers and pensioners at that hour in the morning
was one of the most boring things she'd ever experienced she kept trying to distract herself with
the cards on the table finding little details that she'd never noticed before
now and then wicca would ask if she was still listening and she'd give a mumbled yes but her mind was miles away traveling
wandering about in places she'd never been to before every detail on the card seemed to push
her farther on in that journey all of a sudden like someone entering a
dream breda realized that she could no longer hear what wicca was saying
a voice a voice that seemed to come from within but which she knew came from outside
began to whisper something to her do you understand breeda said that she
did do you understand asked the mysterious
voice again this however was of no importance the tarot cards before her began to show
fantastic scenes men with bronzed oiled bodies wearing only thongs
and some sporting masks like the giant heads of fish clouds raced across the sky as if
everything were moving much faster than normal and the scene shifted abruptly to a square surrounded by grand buildings
where a few old men were urgently telling secrets to a group of young boys as if some form of very ancient
knowledge were about to be lost forever add seven and eight
and you'll have my number i'm the devil and i signed the book said a boy in
medieval clothes at what appeared to be a celebration drunken men and women smiled out at her the scene changed yet
again to the sea to reveal temples carved out of the rocks and then the sky
began to be covered by black clouds pierced by brilliant flashes of lightning a door appeared it was a heavy door
like the door of an old castle the door came closer to breida and she had a sense that soon she would
be able to open it come back said the voice
come back said the voice on the phone it was wicca breda was annoyed with her for
interrupting such a remarkable experience merely to bore her with more talk about
caretakers and plumbers just a moment she replied she was
struggling to find that door but everything had vanished i know what
happened wicca told her brita was stunned in a state of shock
she couldn't understand what was going on i know what happened wicca said again in
response to breida's silence i won't say anything more about the plumber he was here last week and fixed
everything before hanging up she said she would expect breda at the agreed-upon time
breeda put down the phone without saying goodbye she sat for a long time staring at the kitchen wall before
subsiding into convulsive soothing sobs
[Music]
[Music]
it was a trick wicker told a frightened breeder when they sat down again in the italian armchairs
i know how you must be feeling she went on sometimes we set off down a path simply because we don't believe in it
it's easy enough all we have to do then is prove that it isn't the right path for us
however when things start to happen and the path does reveal itself to us we become afraid of carrying on wicca
said that she didn't understand why so many people chose to spend their whole life destroying paths they didn't even
want to follow instead of following the one path that would lead them somewhere
i can't believe it was a trick protested brita she had lost her heir of arrogance and
defiance her respect for wicca had grown considerably no no the vision wasn't a trick the
trick i'm referring to is the phone for millions of years we only ever spoke to someone we could see
then in less than a century seeing and speaking were suddenly separated we think it's quite normal now and don't
realize the huge impact it has on our reflexes our body still hasn't got used to it the
practical result is that when we speak on the phone we often enter a state very similar to
certain magical trances our mind tunes into another frequency and becomes more receptive to the
invisible world i know some witches who always keep a pen and paper by the phone
and while they're talking to someone they sit doodling apparently nonsensical things when they hang up though they find that
their doodles are often symbols from the tradition of the moon but why did the tarot reveal itself to
me that's the great problem with anyone wanting to study magic replied wicca when we set out on the
path we always have a fairly clear idea of what we hope to find women are generally seeking their
soulmate and men are looking for power neither party is really interested in learning they simply want to reach the
thing they have set as their goal but the path of magic like the path of life
is and always will be the path of mystery learning something means coming into
contact with a world of which you know nothing in order to learn you must be humble
like plunging into the dark knight said breida don't interrupt there was a note of
barely contained irritation in wicca's voice but brita realized that it wasn't because of what she'd said
maybe she's angry with the magus she thought perhaps she was once in love with him
they are more or less the same age i'm sorry she said that's all right
wicca seemed equally surprised by her own reaction you were telling me about the tarot
when you were spreading the cards you always had a preconceived idea of what would happen
you never let the cards tell their own story you were trying to make them confirm what you imagined you knew
i realized this when we started talking on the phone i realized too that it was a sign and that the phone
was my ally so i launched into a very boring conversation and asked you to look at
the cards you went into the trance provoked by the phone and the cards led you into their
magical world wicca suggested that the next time breida was with someone who was talking
on the phone she should take a good look at their eyes she would be surprised by what she saw
i want to ask something else said brita over tea in wicca's surprisingly modern and practical kitchen i want to know why
you didn't let me abandon the path because thought wicca i want to find out
what the magus saw in you apart i mean from your gift what she said was
because you have a gift how do you know easy by your ears
by my ears how disappointing breeda thought to herself and there was me thinking she could see
my aura everyone has a gift but some are born with a more highly developed gift than
others me for example who have to struggle really hard to develop their gift
people who were born with a gift have very small attached earlobes instinctively breda touched her earlobes
it was true do you have a car no breeda said she
didn't then prepare to spend a fortune on taxi fares said wicca
getting up it's time to take our next step things are suddenly moving very fast
thought breeda as she got to her feet life was beginning to resemble the clouds she had seen in her trance
by around mid-afternoon they had reached some mountains about 15 miles south of dublin
we could have made the same trip by bus brida grumbled to herself while she paid the taxi
wicca had brought with her a bag and some clothes if you like i can wait said the driver
it's going to be pretty difficult finding another taxi in these parts this is the middle of nowhere
don't worry said wicca to breeda's relief we always get what we want
the driver gave them a strange look and drove off they were standing before a grove of trees that extended as far as the foot
of the nearest mountain ask permission to enter said wicca
the spirits of the forests always appreciate good manners breda asked permission the wood which
had up until then been just an ordinary wood seemed suddenly to come to life
stay on the bridge between the visible and the invisible said wicca while they walked among the
trees everything in the universe has life and you must always try to stay in contact with that life
it understands your language and the world will begin to take on a different meaning for you
breeda was surprised at wicca's agility her feet seemed to levitate above the ground making almost no noise
they reached a clearing near a huge stone while she tried to think how that stone could have got there
breda noticed the ashes from a fire right in the middle of the open space it was a beautiful place
it would still be some hours before evening and the sun shone with the warm gold of summer
afternoons birds were singing and a light breeze rustled in the leaves
they were quite high up and she could look across and down at the horizon wicca took a kind of cloak out of her
bag and put it on over her clothes then she placed the bag near the trees so that it couldn't be seen from the
clearing sit down she said wicca was somehow different
breda couldn't decide whether it was the cloak or the profound respect that the place inspired in her
first of all i must explain what i'm going to do i'm going to find out how the gift
manifests itself in you i can only begin to teach you once i know something about your gift
wicca asked brita to try and relax to surrender herself to the beauty of the place
just as she had when she had surrendered to the tarot cards at some point in one of your past lives
you set out along the road of magic i know this from the tarot visions that you described
brita closed her eyes but wicca asked her to open them again magical places are always beautiful and
deserve to be contemplated waterfalls mountains and forests are all
places where the spirits of earth tend to play and laugh and speak to us you are in a sacred place and it is
showing you the birds and the wind thank god for this for the birds the wind
and for the spirits who inhabit this wood always stay on the bridge between the
visible and the invisible wicca's voice was making brita feel more and more relaxed
she felt an almost religious respect for the moment the other day i spoke to you about one
of the great secrets of magic the soulmate the whole of man's life on
the face of earth can be summed up by that search for his soulmate he may pretend to be running
after wisdom money or power but none of that matters whatever he achieves will be incomplete
if he fails to find his soulmate with the exception of a few creatures who are descended from the angels
and who need solitude in order to encounter god the rest of humanity will only achieve
union with god if at some point at some moment in their life they managed to commune with their
soulmate breda noticed a strange energy in the air for a few moments and for some reason
she could not explain her eyes filled with tears in the night
of time when we were separated one of those parts was charged with nurturing and maintaining knowledge
man he went on to understand agriculture nature and the movements of the stars in
the sky knowledge was always the power that kept the universe in its place
and the stars turning in their orbits that was the glory of man to nurture and maintain knowledge
and that is why the whole human race has survived two women was given something far more
subtle and fragile but without which knowledge makes no sense at all
and that thing was transformation the men left the soil fertile we sowed seeds
and the soil was transformed into trees and plants
the soil needs the seed and the seed needs the soil the one only has meaning with the other
it is the same thing with human beings when male knowledge joins with female transformation
then the great magical union is created and its name is wisdom wisdom means both to know
and to transform breda noticed that the wind was growing stronger
and that wicca's voice was leading her again into a trance the spirits of the forest seemed alive
and intent lie down said wicca breda leaned back
and stretched out her legs up above her gloated deep blue cloudless sky
go in search of your gift i can't go with you today but don't be afraid the more you
understand yourself the more you will understand the world and the closer you will be to your
soulmate wicca knelt down and looked at the young
woman she's just as i once was she thought fondly
in search of a meaning for everything and capable of looking at the world as did the strong
confident women of old who were quite happy to rule over their own communities
at that time however god had been a woman wicca bent over breida's body and
unbuckled the belt of brita's jeans then half unzipped them breida's muscles
tensed don't worry said wicca affectionately she lifted up breida's t-shirt to reveal
her navel then she took from the pocket of her cloak a quartz crystal and placed it on
breida's navel now i want you to close your eyes she
said softly i want you to imagine the color of the sky
but keep your eyes closed she took from her cloak a small amethyst
and placed it between brita's closed eyes from now on do exactly as i tell you
and don't worry about anything else you are in the center of the universe
you can see the stars all around you and some of the brighter planets experience this landscape as something
that wraps about you completely and not like a picture or a screen take pleasure in contemplating this
universe there's no need to worry about anything else simply concentrate on your own
pleasure without any feelings of guilt breida saw the starry universe and
realized that she could step into it even while she was listening to wicca's voice the voice asked her to imagine a
vast cathedral in the middle of the universe breida duly saw a gothic cathedral made
of dark stone and which absurd though it might seem appeared to form
part of the surrounding universe walk over to the cathedral and up the steps
go inside breida did as wica ordered she went up the cathedral steps
conscious of her bare feet on the cold stone floor at one point she had a feeling that
there was someone with her and wicca's voice seemed to emerge from a person walking behind her
i'm imagining things thought breida but suddenly she remembered what she'd been told about the bridge between the
visible and the invisible she mustn't feel afraid of disappointment or failure
breda was now standing in front of the cathedral door it was an enormous wrought iron affair
adorned with scenes from the lives of the saints and totally different from the one she had seen on her journey through the
tarot cards open the door and go in breda felt the cold metal of the handle
beneath her hand despite the door's great size it opened easily she entered and found herself inside a
vast church notice everything around you said wicca
although it was dark outside light came streaming in through the cathedral's huge stained glass windows
she could make out the pews the side altars the decorated columns and a few lit candles yet everything
seemed somehow empty and abandoned the pews were covered in dust
walk over to your left somewhere you will find another door but this time it will be a very small
one brita walked through the cathedral she was aware of the unpleasant feeling of
the dusty floor beneath her bare feet somewhere a friendly voice was guiding her she knew it was wicca
but she knew too that she no longer had any control over her imagination she was conscious and yet she could not
disobey what was being asked of her she found the door go in
there's a spiral staircase leading down brida had to crouch to get through the
door the walls of the staircase were lined with torches fixed to the wall illuminating the steps the steps were
very clean someone had clearly been there before in order to light the torches
you are setting off in search of your past lives in the cellar of this cathedral is a
library that's where we're going now i'll be waiting at the foot of the staircase
breeda kept going down and down for how long she didn't know it made her slightly dizzy when she did
finally reach the bottom wicca was there in her cloak it would be easier now
she felt more protected she was still deep in her trance wicca opened another door opposite the
stairs i'm going to leave you alone here i'll be outside waiting
choose a book and it will show you what you need to know breeda didn't even notice that wicca was
no longer there she was staring at the dusty tomes i really should come here more often and
give everything a good clean her past was grubby and neglected and she felt sad to think that she'd never
read any of these books before perhaps they contained important long forgotten lessons that she could
incorporate into her life she looked at the books on the shelf all those
lives she thought if she was so very ancient she really should be wiser she wished
she could read them all but she didn't have much time and she must trust her intuition
she could come back whenever she wanted now that she knew the way she stood for a while not knowing which
book to choose then she chose one almost at random it was a fairly slim volume
and breda took it and sat down on the floor she placed the book on her lap but felt afraid she might open it and find
that nothing happened afraid that she might not be able to read what was written there
i need to take risks i need to feel the fear of failing she thought as she opened the book as
soon as she glanced at the pages she began to feel ill and dizzy again i'm going to faint
she managed to think before everything went dark
she woke with water dripping on her face she'd had a strange incomprehensible dream about cathedrals
floating in the air and libraries crammed with books and yet she had never been in a library lonnie
are you all right no she wasn't she couldn't feel her right foot and she
knew this was a bad sign she didn't feel like talking either because she didn't want to forget the
dream lonnie wake up she must be feverish
delirious and yet what she saw in her delirium seemed so intensely real
she wished the person who kept calling to her would stop because the dream was now fast disappearing before she had managed to
grasp its meaning the sky was cloudy and the clouds were so low they almost touched the castle's
tallest tower she lay looking up at the clouds it was just as well she couldn't see the stars
according to the priests not even the stars were entirely good the rain had stopped shortly before she
opened her eyes lonnie was pleased it had rained for that meant the castle's water butts
would be full she slowly shifted her gaze from the clouds to the tower to the bonfires in the courtyard and the
bewildered crowds of people milling around talbo
she said softly he put his arms around her she felt the cold of his armor and the
smell of soot in his hair how much time has passed what day is it
you've been asleep for three days said talbot she looked at tabo and felt sorry for
him he was thinner his face grimy his skin dull not that any of this mattered
she loved him i'm thirsty talbo there's no water the french found the
secret passageway again she heard the voices inside her head for a long time she had hated those
voices her husband was a warrior a mercenary who spent most of the year away
fighting and she had always been afraid that the voices would tell her that he had died in battle
she had found a way of keeping the voices from speaking to her she just had to concentrate her mind on
an ancient tree near her village the voices stopped when she did that now
however she was too weak and the voices had returned you're going to die said the voices
but he will be saved but it rained talbo she said i need
water it was only a few drops nothing like enough
lonnie again looked up at the clouds they had been there all week and had done nothing but block the sun
making the winter even colder in the castle even gloomier perhaps the french catholics were right
perhaps god was on their side a few mercenaries came over to them
fires were burning everywhere and lonnie had the sudden feeling that she was in hell
the priests are gathering everyone together sir one of them said to talbot we were hired to fight not to die said
another the french have offered us terms of surrender replied talbo
they say that those who convert back to the catholic faith can leave unharmed the perfect ones
will not accept the voices whispered to lonnie she knew that she knew the perfect ones
well they were the reason she was there and not at home where she usually waited for talbot to return from battle the perfect
ones had been besieged in that castle for four months and during that time the village women
had used the secret passageway connecting village and castle to bring in food clothes and ammunition
during that time they had been able to see their husbands and it was because of them that the fighting had continued
now however the secret passage had been discovered and she could not go back to the village
nor could any of the other women she tried to sit up her foot didn't hurt anymore
the voices were telling her that this was a bad sign we have nothing to do with their god
we're not going to die over that sir said another soldier a gong began to
sound inside the castle talbo got to his feet please
take me with you she implored talbot looked at his companions and then
at the woman who lay trembling before him for a moment he didn't know what to do
his men were accustomed to war and they knew that warriors who were in love usually hid
during battles i'm going to die talbo take me with you please
one of the mercenaries glanced at talbo she shouldn't be left here alone he said the french might start firing
again talbo pretended to agree he knew that
the french would do no such thing a truce had been called in order to negotiate the surrender of monsegur
but the mercenary understood what was going on in talbot's heart he too must be a man in love
he knows you're going to die the voices said to lonnie while talbot gently picked her up lonnie
didn't want to listen to what the voices were saying she was remembering a day when they'd walked along together just like that
through a wheat field on a summer afternoon she had been thirsty then as well and they had drunk water from a mountain
stream a crowd of men soldiers women and children were gathered round the great rock that
formed part of the western wall of the fortress of monsegur an oppressive silence hung in the air
and lonnie knew that this was not out of respect for the priests but out of fear for what might happen
the priests arrived there were a great many of them all wearing black cloaks
each embroidered with a huge yellow cross they sat down on the rock on the steps
on the ground at the foot of the tower the last to arrive had white hair and he climbed up to the highest part of the
wall his figure was lit by the flames from the fires and the wind caught his black cloak
almost everyone present knelt down and bending forward hands pressed together in prayer beat
their head three times on the ground talbot and his mercenaries remained standing
they had only been hired to fight we have been granted surrender said the
priest you are all free to leave a great sigh of relief
came from the crowd the souls belonging to the other god
will remain in the kingdom of this world the souls belonging to the true god
will return to his infinite mercy the war will continue but it is not an
eternal war because the other god will be defeated in the end even though some of the angels have
already been corrupted by him the other god will be vanquished but not destroyed
he will remain in hell for all eternity along with the souls he managed to
seduce the people in the crowd stared at the man standing on the wall
they were not so sure now that they wanted to escape and thus suffer for all eternity the
cathar church is the true church the priest went on thanks to jesus christ and to the holy
spirit we have achieved communion with god we do not need to be reincarnated
we do not need to return to the kingdom of the other god lonnie noticed that three priests
bearing bibles had stepped forward the consular mentum will now be distributed to those who wish to die
with us down below the fire awaits it will be a horrible death
involving terrible suffering it will be a slow death and the pain of flames burning your
flesh will be unlike any you have experienced before however not all of you will have that
honor only the true cathars the others will be condemned to live
two women shyly went up to the priests who were holding the bibles an adolescent boy wrenched himself free
from his mother's arms and joined them four mercenaries approached tabo we want
to receive the sacrament sir we want to be baptized this
is how the tradition survives said the voices because people are willing to die for an
idea lonnie waited to hear tabo's decision the mercenaries had fought all their
lives purely for money until they met these people prepared to fight only for what they deemed to be
right talbo finally nodded his ascent even though it meant losing some of his best
men let's go said lonnie let's go over to the walls
they said that anyone who wants to can leave it's better that we rest lonnie
you're going to die whispered the voices again
i want to see the pyrenees i want to see the valley one more time talbo you know that i'm going to die
yes he knew he was a man accustomed to battlefields
and he could tell when a wound would prove to be the death of one of his soldiers lonnie's wound had been open for three
days poisoning her blood those whose wounds did not heal might last two days
or two weeks but never longer than that and lonnie was close to death her fever
had passed taboo knew that this too was a bad sign as long as the foot hurt and the fever
burned that meant the organism was still fighting now the struggle was over
and it was only a matter of time you are not afraid said the voices
no lonnie wasn't afraid even as a child she had known that death was merely another beginning
at that time the voices had been her great companions they had faces bodies and gestures
visible only to her they were people who came from different worlds they talked to her and never let
her feel lonely she'd had a very interesting childhood playing with the other children but
using her invisible friends to shift objects around and make strange noises
that startled her companions her mother was glad that they lived in a cathar country
if the catholics were here you'd be burned alive she used to say the cathars paid no
attention to such things they believed that the good were good the bad were bad and that no force in
the universe could change this then the french arrived saying that there was no cathar country
and since the age of eight all she had known was war the war had brought her one very good
thing her husband hired in some distant land by the cathar priests
who never themselves took up arms but it brought something bad too the fear of being burned alive because
the catholics were moving ever closer to her village she began to feel afraid of her invisible friends and they gradually
disappeared from her life however the voices remained they continued to tell her what was going to
happen and how she should behave but she didn't want their friendship because they always
knew too much then one voice taught her the trick of thinking about that ancient
tree and she hadn't heard the voices at all since the last crusade against the cathars had begun
and the french catholics had continued to win battle after battle today though she didn't have the
strength to think about the tree the voices were back and she didn't mind on the contrary she needed them
they would show her the path once she was dead don't worry about me tabo i'm not afraid
of dying she said they reached the top of the wall
a cold relentless wind was blowing and taubo drew his cloak more tightly about him
loni didn't feel the cold anymore she could see the lights of a town on the horizon
and the lights of the encampment at the foot of the mountain all along the valley bottom bonfires
were lit the french soldiers were awaiting the final decision the notes from a flute wafted up from
below along with the sound of voices singing it's the soldiers said talbo they know
they could die at any moment and that's why for them life is one long celebration
lonnie felt suddenly furious with life the voices were telling her that talbo would meet other women
have children and grow rich on what he plundered from cities but he will never love anyone as he has
loved you because you are part of him forever said the voices
lonnie and talbo their arms about each other remained for a while gazing down on the
landscape below listening to the soldiers singing lonnie sensed that the mountain had been the
setting of other wars in the past a past so remote that not even the voices could remember it
we are eternal talbot that's what the voices used to tell me in the days when i could see their bodies and faces
talbo knew about his wife's gift but she had not mentioned it for a long time perhaps it was the effect of the fever
and yet no one life is the same as any other life it might be that we will never meet
again and i need you to know that i've loved you all my life i loved you even before i met you
you're part of me i'm going to die and since tomorrow is as good a day to
die as any i would like to die with the priests i've never understood their ideas about
the world but they have always understood me i want to accompany them into the next
life i might prove to be a good guide because i visited those worlds before
lonnie thought how ironic fate was she had been afraid of the voices because they might set her on the path that
would lead her to the fire and yet there the fire was waiting for her
talbo looked at his wife her eyes were growing dull and yet she still retained the same
peculiar charm that had first drawn him to her he had never told her certain things about the women he received as part of
the booty of battle the women he met while he was traveling the world the women who were expecting
him to return one day he hadn't told her this because he was certain that she knew everything anyway
and forgave him because he was her great love and a great love is above the things of
this world but there was something else he had never told her and which she would possibly never know
that she with her affection and her gaiety had been largely responsible for him having rediscovered the meaning of
life that her love had driven him to the far corners of the earth because he needed to be rich enough to
buy some land and live in peace with her for the rest of his days it was his utter confidence in this
fragile creature whose life was now fading fast that had made him fight with honor
because he knew that after the battle he could forget all the horrors of war in her arms and
that despite all the women he had known only there in her arms could he close his eyes and sleep like a child
go and call the priest tabo she said i want to be baptized talbo hesitated
for a moment only warriors choose how they will die but that woman had given her life for
love and perhaps for her love was a strange form of war
he got up and walked down the steps in the wall lonnie tried to concentrate on the music coming from below
and which was somehow making dying easier meanwhile the voices kept talking
in her life every woman can make use of the four rings of revelation
you have used only one the wrong one they said lonnie looked at her fingers
they were torn and cracked the nails filthy there was no ring
the voices laughed you know what we mean they said the virgin the saint
the martyr and the witch lonnie knew in her heart what the voices
were saying but she couldn't remember what it meant she had heard about it a long time ago
in an age when people dressed differently and saw the world differently too she'd
had another name then and had spoken another language they are the four ways in which a woman
can commune with the universe the voices said as if it were important for her to recall these ancient things
the virgin has the power of both man and woman she is condemned to solitude but
solitude reveals its secrets that is the price paid by the virgin to
need no one to wear herself out in her love for others and through solitude
to discover the wisdom of the world lonnie was still looking at the encampment down below
yes she knew these things and the martyr the voices went on the martyr has the
power of those who cannot be harmed by pain and suffering she surrenders herself
suffers and through sacrifice discovers the wisdom of the world
lonnie again looked at her hands there shining invisibly she saw the ring of the martyr
encircling one of her fingers you could have chosen the revelation of the saint even if it wasn't the right
ring for you the voices said the saint has the courage of those for whom giving
is the only way of receiving they are a bottomless well from which people can constantly draw water to drink
and if the well runs dry the saint offers her blood so that others need never go thirsty
through surrender the saint discovers the wisdom of the world
the voices fell silent lonnie heard talbo coming up the stone steps
she knew which ring should have been hers in that life because it was the one she had worn in
all her past lives when she had been known by other names and had spoken other tongues
with that ring the wisdom of the world was discovered through pleasure but she didn't want to
think about that now the ring of the martyr was shining invisible on her finger
talbo came closer and suddenly when she gazed up at him lonnie noticed that the night had a
magical glow to it as if it were a sunny day wake up
said the voices but these were different voices which she had never heard before
she felt someone rubbing her left wrist come on breeda get up
she opened her eyes and immediately closed them again because the light from the sky was so intense
what a strange thing death was open your eyes said wicker but she
needed to go back to the castle a man she loved had gone off in search of a priest
she couldn't just run away he was alone and he needed her tell me what your gift is wicca didn't
give her time to think she knew she had been through something extraordinary much more powerful than
her experience with the tarot cards yet still she didn't give her time to think wicca neither understood nor
respected her feelings all she wanted was to find out what her gift was
talk to me about your gift wicca insisted breida took a deep breath holding in her
anger but there was no escape the woman would keep insisting until she told her what
she wanted to know i was a woman in love with wicca quickly
covered breida's mouth then she stood up made a few strange gestures in the air and turned back to
her god is the word always be very careful what you say in any situation
and at any moment breida didn't understand why wicca was behaving like this god manifests himself in
everything but the word is one of his most favored methods of doing so because the word is thought transformed
into vibration you are projecting into the air around you something which before was only
energy take great care with everything you say wicca said again the word has more power
than many rituals breida still didn't understand the only way she had of describing her experience
was through words when you spoke of a woman wiki explained
you were not that woman you were part of her other people might well have the same
memory as you breeda felt robbed that woman had been
so strong and she didn't want to share her with anyone besides there was talbot too
talk to me about your gift wicca said yet again she couldn't allow the girl to be too
dazzled by the experience this form of time travel often brought problems
i have so many things to tell and i need to talk to you because no one else will believe me please begged brida
she began to tell her everything from the moment when the rain was dripping on her face she had a chance and she couldn't waste
it the chance to be with someone who believed in the extraordinary she knew that no one else would listen
to her with the same respect because people were afraid of discovering that life was magical
they were used to their houses their jobs their expectations and if someone turned up saying that it
was possible to travel in time that it was possible to see castles adrift in the universe
tarot cards that told stories men who walked through the dark night
people who had never experienced such things would feel that life had cheated them
life as far as they were concerned was the same every day every night every weekend that's why
breda needed to seize that chance if words were god then let it be
recorded on the air around her that she had traveled back in time and that she remembered
every detail as if it were now as if it were the wood where they were right now
and so when later on someone managed to prove to her that none of this had happened
when time and space made her doubt it all when she herself was convinced that it had been mere
illusion the words spoken that evening there in the wood would still be vibrating in the air and
at least one person someone for whom magic was part of life would know that it had really happened
she described the castle the priests in the black and yellow robes the valley filled with fires the husband
thinking thoughts that she could read without him speaking them wicca listened patiently only showing
any interest when she told her about the voices that appeared in lonnie's mind then she would interrupt and asked if
the voices were male or female they were both if they expressed any particular emotion
aggression or sympathy no they were impersonal and if she could summon up the voices
whenever she wished she didn't know she hadn't had time to find out
all right we can leave now said wicca taking off her cloak and putting it back
in her bag breeda was disappointed she thought she might receive some words of praise
or at the very least some explanation but wicca resembled one of those doctors
who studied their patient very coolly and objectively more interested in noting down symptoms
than in understanding the pain and suffering caused by those symptoms they made the long journey back whenever
breda tried to raise the subject again wicca would show a sudden interest in the increase in the cost of living
in the rush hour traffic jams and the difficulty she was having with the manager of the building where she lived
only when they were once more sitting in the usual two armchairs did wicca comment on breida's experience
i just want to say one thing to you she said don't bother trying to explain your
emotions live everything as intensely as you can and keep whatever you felt
as a gift from god if you think that you won't be able to stand a world in which living is more important than
understanding then give up magic now the best way to destroy the bridge
between the visible and the invisible is by trying to explain your emotions
emotions were like wild horses and breda knew that reason could never entirely master them when a
boyfriend once left her giving no explanation she had stayed at home for months going
over and over his many defects and the thousand and one things that had been wrong with their relationship
yet she woke up every morning thinking about him and knowing that if he phoned her she would probably agree to meet
the dog in the kitchen barked breeda knew this was a sign that her visit was over
oh please we haven't even talked about what happened she cried and there are two questions i
simply must ask wicca stood up the girl always found a way of leaving any important questions
to the very last moment just when it was time for her to leave i want to know if the priests i saw
really existed we have extraordinary experiences and less than two hours later we're trying
to convince ourselves that it was the mere product of our imagination said wicca going over to the bookshelves
breida remembered that when they were in the wood she herself had been thinking about people who were afraid of the
extraordinary and she felt ashamed of herself wicca returned bearing a book the cathars
or the perfect ones were the priests of a church founded in the south of france at the end of the 12th century
they believed in reincarnation and in the existence of absolute good and absolute evil the world was
divided into the chosen and the lost which meant that there was no point in trying to convert anyone
the cathar's indifference to worldly values led many of the feudal lords in the longdoc region
to adopt their religion as a way of avoiding having to pay the heavy taxes imposed at the time by the catholic
church equally since it had been decided at birth who was good and who was bad
the cathars were very tolerant in their attitude to sex and in particular in their attitude to women
they were only strict about such matters with those who had been ordained as priests everything was fine until catharism
started to spread the catholic church felt threatened and called for a crusade against the heretics
for 40 years cathars and catholics fought bloody battles but the legalist forces with the support
of various other nations finally managed to destroy all the towns that had adopted the new religion
only the fortress of monsegur in the pyrenees remained and the cathars besieged there held out
until the french discovered the secret passageway through which they had been receiving supplies one march morning
in 1244 after the surrender of the castle 220 cathars hurled themselves singing
into the huge bonfire lit at the bottom of the mountain on which the castle had been built wicca
said all this with the book still closed on her lap only when she had finished her story did
she open it and leaf through it looking for a photograph breida saw the ruined building with a
tower almost completely destroyed but with the walls intact there was the courtyard
the steps lonnie and talbo had climbed the rock that formed part of the wall and the tower
you said there was another question you wanted to ask me the question was of no importance now
breeda could hardly think straight she felt odd with some effort she managed to remember what it was she had
wanted to ask i want to know why you're wasting your time with me why you want to teach me
because that is what the tradition is telling me to do replied wicca in your successive incarnations you
changed very little you belong to the same group as people like myself and my friends
we are the ones charged with maintaining the tradition of the moon you are a witch breda paid no attention
to what wicca was saying it didn't even occur to her to make another appointment to meet all she wanted at that moment was to
leave to be among ordinary things that would bring her back to her familiar world
a damp stain on the wall a packet of cigarettes discarded on the floor some letters left on the porter's desk
i have to work tomorrow she was suddenly concerned about the time
on her way back home she started pondering her company's invoicing system for exports
and came up with a way of simplifying certain administrative procedures she felt very pleased her boss might
approve of what she was doing and who knows give her a raise she got home had supper and watched a
bit of television then she wrote down her thoughts about invoicing on a piece of paper and fell exhausted into bed the invoicing of
exports had taken on great importance in her life that after all was what she was paid to do
nothing else existed everything else was a lie
for a whole week breed awoke promptly worked hard at the office and received due praise from her boss
she didn't miss one of her classes and took an interest in everything printed in all the magazines at the newsstand
all she needed was to avoid thinking whenever thoughts surfaced of her meeting with a magus in the forest
or with a witch in the city she immediately drove them out by reminding herself that she had exams next week
or by recalling a remark made by one female friend about another friday came around and her boyfriend met
her outside the university to go to the cinema afterward they went to their usual bar
talked about the film their colleagues and about their respective jobs they bumped into friends who were on
their way back from a party and decided to join them for supper grateful that in dublin you could always
find a restaurant open at two o'clock in the morning they said goodbye to their friends and decided to go back to her place as
soon as they got in she put on a record by iron butterfly and poured them each a double whiskey
they lay on the sofa with their arms around each other silent and abstracted while he stroked her hair and her
breasts it's been a really crazy week she said suddenly
i worked non-stop prepared for my exams and did all the shopping the record finished she got up to turn
it over you know the cupboard door in the kitchen the one that had come unstuck
well i finally managed to arrange a date for someone to come and fix it and i had to go to the bank several
times as well once to collect some money my dad sent me and again to deposit some checks for the
firm and then laurens was staring at her why are you staring at me
she asked rather aggressively who was this man lying on the sofa staring at
her incapable of saying anything of interest it was quite absurd she didn't need him she didn't need
anyone why are you staring at me she asked again
but he said nothing he merely stood up went over to her and very tenderly led her back to the
sofa you're not listening to anything i say said brita
confused lauren's put his arms around her emotions are like wild horses she
thought tell me everything lauren said sweetly
i'll listen and respect whatever decision you make even if you've met someone else even if
this is goodbye we've been together for a while now i may not know you that well
i mean i don't know exactly who you are but i know who you're not and you haven't been yourself all night
breida felt like crying but she'd shed so many tears already over dark nights
talking tarot cards and enchanted forests emotions really were like wild horses
and all she could do now was set them free she sat down in front of him remembering
that the magus and wicca both favored that position then she gave him a complete account of
everything that had happened since her meeting with the magus in the forest lawrence listened in total silence when
she told him about the photograph of monsegur laurens asked if she had perhaps heard
about the catharts in one of her university courses look i know you don't believe a word of
what i've told you she retorted you think it was my unconscious mind that i just remembered things i already
knew but no lauren's i had never heard of the cathars before but you of course have an explanation
for everything her hands were shaking uncontrollably lawrence got to his feet
picked up a piece of paper and made two holes in it about eight inches apart he placed the
sheet of paper on the table leaning it against the whiskey bottle so that it was vertical
then he went into the kitchen and returned bearing a cork he sat at the head of the table pushed
the piece of paper and the bottle to the other end and put the cork in front of him come
over here he said brita got up she was trying to hide her shaking hands
not that he appeared to notice let's pretend that this cork is an electron one of the
small particles that make up the atom do you understand she nodded
right well listen carefully if i had certain highly complicated bits of
apparatus with me that would allow me to shoot an electron in the direction of that piece of paper
it would pass through the two holes at the same time except that it would do so without
splitting into two i don't believe it she said that's
impossible lawrence took the piece of paper and threw it away then being a tidy person
he put the cork back where it belonged you may not believe it but it's true
it's something that scientists know but can't explain i don't believe a thing you've told me
but i know that it's true breeda's hands were still shaking
but she wasn't crying and she didn't lose control all she noticed was that the effect of
the alcohol had completely worn off she was strangely lucid but
what do scientists do when confronted by these mysteries
they enter the dark night to use a term you taught me we know that the mystery won't ever go
away and so we learn to accept it to live with it i think the same thing happens in many
situations in life a mother bringing up a child must feel that she's plunging into the dark knight
too or an immigrant who travels to a far off country in search of work and money
they believe that their efforts will be rewarded and that one day they'll understand what happened along the way that at the
time seemed so very frightening it isn't explanations that carry us forward
it's our desire to go on breida suddenly felt immensely tired she
needed to sleep sleep was the only magical kingdom into which she could freely enter
that night she had a beautiful dream full of seas and leafy islands she woke in the early hours and was glad
that lawrence was there beside her she got up and went over to the bedroom window where she looked out over the
sleeping city of dublin she thought of her father who used to do just that with her whenever she woke
feeling frightened the memory brought with it another scene from her childhood
she was on the beach with her father and he asked her to go and see what the temperature of the water was like
she was five years old and glad to be able to help she went to the water's edge and dipped
in a toe i put my feet in and it's cold she told him
her father picked her up and carried her down to the water again and without any warning threw her in she was shocked at first
but then laughed out loud at the trick he'd played how's the water asked her father
it's lovely she replied right from now on whenever you want to find
out about something plunge straight in she had quickly forgotten this lesson
she may only have been 21 but she had already nurtured many enthusiasms which she had abandoned as quickly as
she had taken them up she wasn't afraid of difficulties what frightened her was being forced to
choose one particular path choosing a path meant having to miss out on others she had a whole life to live
and she was always thinking that in the future she might regret the choices she made now
i'm afraid of committing myself she thought to herself she wanted to follow all possible paths
and so ended up following none even in that most important area of her life love
she had failed to commit herself after her first romantic disappointment she had never again given herself
entirely she feared pain loss and separation these things were
inevitable on the path to love and the only way of avoiding them was by deciding not to take that path at all
in order not to suffer you had to renounce love it was like putting out your own eyes in
order not to see the bad things in life life is so complicated you had to take
risks follow some paths and abandon others she remembered wicca telling her about
people who followed certain paths only to prove that they weren't the right ones but that wasn't as bad as choosing a
path and then spending the rest of your life wondering if you'd made the right choice no one could make a choice without
feeling afraid that was the law of life that was the dark night
and no one could escape the dark knight even if they never made a decision even if they lacked the courage to
change anything because that in itself was a decision a change
except without the benefit of the treasures hidden in the dark knight lawrence might be right in the end they
would laugh at their initial fears just as she had laughed at the snakes and scorpions she had imagined were there in
the forest in her despair she had forgotten that ireland's patron saint
st patrick had long ago driven out all the snakes i'm so glad you exist laurence she said
softly afraid that he might hear she went back to bed and soon fell asleep
before she did though she remembered another story about her father it was sunday and they and all the
family were having lunch at her grandmother's house she must have been about 14 and she was
complaining about not being able to do a homework assignment because every time she started it went
wrong perhaps the times when it goes wrong are teaching you something
said her father but breida was sure that she'd taken the wrong path and that there was no way to put things right
her father took her by the hand and led her into the living room where her grandmother used to watch
television there was a large antique grandfather clock which had stopped years before because
it could no longer be repaired nothing in the world is ever completely wrong my dear
said her father looking at the clock even a stopped clock is right twice a day
she walked for some time in the wooded mountains before she found the magus he was sitting on a rock near the top of
the mountain contemplating the valley and the mountains to the west it was a really beautiful view and
breeder recalled that spirits preferred such places is god only the god of beauty she asked
is she approached if so what about the ugly people and places of the world
the magus did not reply brita felt embarrassed you probably don't remember me i was
here two months ago i spent the whole night alone in the forest i promised myself that i would
only come back when i had discovered my path i've met a woman called a wicca
the magus started but realized with relief that the girl hadn't noticed then he smiled to himself at the irony
of fate wicca told me that i'm a witch the girl went on
don't you trust her this was the first question the magus had asked since she
arrived and breda was pleased to know that he was actually listening to what she was saying up until then she hadn't been sure yes i
trust her she said and i trust in the tradition of the moon but i know too that the tradition of the
sun helped me by forcing me to understand about the dark night that's why i came back then sit down and
enjoy the sunset said the magus i'm not staying alone in the forest again
she replied the last time i was here the magus interrupted her don't say that
god is in the word wicca had said much the same thing
what did i say wrong if you say it was the last time
it might well turn out to be the last what you meant was the most recent time i was here
breeda was worried she would have to take great care with her words from now on
she decided to sit quietly and do as the mega said and watch the sunset doing so made her
nervous it would not be dark for nearly an hour and she had a lot to talk about and many things to say and ask
whenever she sat still just looking at something she got the feeling that she was wasting
precious time when she should be doing things or meeting people she could be spending her time so much
better because there was still so much to learn and yet as the sun sank lower on the
horizon and the clouds filled up with rays of gold and pink brida had the feeling that what she was
struggling for in life was exactly this to be able to sit one day
and contemplate just such a sunset do you know how to pray asked the magus
at one point of course she did everyone knew how to pray right as soon as the sun touches the
horizon say a prayer in the tradition of the sun it is through prayers that we commune
with god a prayer when couched in the words of the soul is far more powerful
than any ritual i don't know how to pray because my soul is silent said breida
the magus laughed only the truly enlightened have silent souls so why
can't i pray with my soul then because you lack the humility to listen to it and find out what it wants
you're embarrassed to listen to the urgings of your soul and afraid to take those requests to god
because you think he doesn't have time to concern himself with them she was watching a sunset sitting beside
a sage however as always happened at such moments she had the feeling that she
didn't deserve to be there it's true that i feel unworthy i always think the spiritual search was made for
people better than me those people if they exist don't need to
search for anything they are the manifestation of the spirit the search was made for people like us
like us he had said and yet he was a long way ahead of her
god is god in both the tradition of the moon and the tradition of the sun said brita believing that the traditions
were the same and only differed in the ways in which they were taught so teach me how to pray the magus turned
to face the sun and closed his eyes we are human beings lord and we do not
know our own greatness lord give us the humility to ask for what we need
because no desire is vain and no request is futile each of us knows how best to feed our
own soul give us the courage to see our desires as coming from the fount of your eternal
wisdom only by accepting our desires can we begin to understand who we are
amen now it's your turn said the magus
lord help me understand that all the good things in life that happened to me do so because i deserve
them help me understand that what moves me to seek out your truth
is the same force that moved the saints and the doubts i have are the same doubts that the saints had
and my frailties are the same frailties help me to be humble enough to accept that i am no different from other people
amen they sat in silence watching the sunset until the last ray of sun left the
clouds their souls were praying asking for wishes to be granted and
giving thanks that they were together let's go to the pub said the magus
breda and the magus began the walk back again she remembered the day when she had first gone there in search of him
she promised herself that she would go over this story only one more time she didn't need to keep trying to
convince herself the magus studied the girl walking ahead of him and trying to look as if she knew
where she was putting her feet among the damp earth and the stones but stumbling repeatedly
his heart grew lighter for a moment then immediately grew guarded again
sometimes certain of god's blessings arrive by shattering all the windows
it was so good to have breida by his side thought the magus as they walked back down the mountain he was just like other men with the same
frailties and the same virtues and he still wasn't used to the role of teacher
at first when people used to come to that forest from all over ireland to hear his teachings
he spoke of the tradition of the sun and asked people to understand what lay around them
god had stored his wisdom there and they were all capable of understanding it by performing a few simple rituals
the way of teaching the tradition of the son had been described two thousand years before by the apostle paul
and i was with you in weakness and in much fear and trembling and my speech and my message were not
implausible words of wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power
that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of god yet people
seemed incapable of understanding him when he talked to them about the tradition of the son and were disappointed because he was a
man just like other men he said it didn't matter he was a teacher and all he was doing was giving
each person the necessary means to acquire knowledge but they needed much more they needed a
guide they didn't understand about the dark knight they didn't understand that any
guide through the dark knight would only illuminate with his torch what he himself wanted to see
and if by chance that torch should go out the people would be lost because they didn't know the way back
but they needed a guide and to be a good teacher he too had to accept the needs of others
so he started patting out his teachings with unnecessary but fascinating things that everyone could accept and
understand the method worked people learned the tradition of the sun
and when they finally realized that many of the things the magus had told them to do were absolutely useless they laughed at
themselves and the magus was glad because he had finally learned how to teach
breda was different her prayer had deeply touched the magus soul
she had understood that no human being who has walked this planet was or is different from the others few
people were capable of saying out loud that the great teachers from the past had the same qualities and the
same defects as all men and that this in no way diminished their ability to search for god
judging oneself to be inferior to other people was one of the worst acts of pride he
knew because it was the most destructive way of being different
when they reached the bar the magus ordered two whiskeys look at the other customers breeda said
they probably come here every night they probably always do the same thing
the magus was suddenly not so sure that breda really did consider herself to be the same as everyone else
you concern yourself too much with other people he replied they're a mirror of yourself yes i know
i thought i knew what made me happy and what made me sad then suddenly i realized that i need to
think again but it's very hard what made you change your mind love
i know a man who makes me feel complete three days ago he showed me that his world is full of mysteries too and that
i'm not alone the magus remained impassive but he was remembering the thought he'd had earlier
about god's blessing sometimes shattering windows do you love him
what i've realized is that i could love him still more even if i learn nothing new on this path
at least i will have learned one important thing we have to take risks he had been making
great plans for that night as they walked down the mountain he wanted to show how much he needed her
to show that he was just like other men weary of so much solitude but all she
wanted were answers to her questions there's something strange about the air
here breida said the atmosphere appeared to have changed
it's the messengers said the magus artificial demons those who do not form
part of god's left arm those who do not lead us to the light his eyes were shining something really
had changed and there he was talking about demons god created the legion of his left arm
in order to improve us so that we would know what to do with our mission he went on
but he put man in charge of concentrating the powers of darkness and creating his own demons and that was
what he was doing now but we can concentrate the forces of good too
said the girl somewhat alarmed no we can't he needed to be distracted
if only she would ask him something he didn't want to create a demon
in the tradition of the sun they were called messengers and they could do great good or great evil only the most important teachers
were allowed to invoke them he was one of those teachers but he didn't want to invoke such a messenger
now because a messenger could be a dangerous force especially when mixed up with disappointments in love
bredo was confused by his response the magus was behaving strangely
we can't concentrate the forces of good he said again trying hard to focus on what he was
saying the force for good is always diffused like light
when you give off positive vibrations you benefit all humankind but when you concentrate the force of
the messenger you are only benefiting or harming yourself his eyes were still shining he called
over the bartender and paid the bill let's go to my place he said i'm going
to make some tea and you can tell me about the really important questions in your life
breeda hesitated he was an attractive man and she was an attractive woman that
night she feared might put an end to her apprenticeship i must take risks
she said to herself again [Music]
the magus lived a little way outside the village breeden noticed that although his house was very different from
wicca's it was equally comfortable and just as tastefully decorated however there wasn't a book in sight it
was mainly empty space and a few bits of furniture they went into the kitchen to make tea
then came back to the living room why did you come here today asked the magus i promised myself that i
would once i knew something and what do you know well i know a little i know that the
path is simple and therefore more difficult than i thought but i will simplify my soul
anyway my first question is why are you wasting your time with me
because you're my soul mate thought the magus but he said because i need someone to talk to
what do you think of the path i've chosen the tradition of the moon the magus needed to tell the truth even
though he wished the truth was different it was your path wicca is quite right
you are a wit you will learn to use time's memory to discover the lessons that god taught
and he wondered why life was like this why he had met his soul mate only to
find that the one way she could learn was through the tradition of the moon
i only have one more question said brita it was getting late soon there would be
no more buses i need to know the answer and i know that wicca won't teach it to me
i know this because she's a woman like me she'll always be my teacher but on this topic she'll always be a
woman i want to know how to find my soul mate he's right here with you thought the
magus but again he said nothing he went over to one corner of the room and turned out
the lights only a kind of acrylic sculpture remained lit breda hadn't noticed it when she came in
it contained some sort of liquid and bubbles rose and fell inside it filling the room with red and blue
lights we've met twice now said the magus his eyes fixed on the sculpture
i only have permission to teach through the tradition of the sun the tradition of the sun awakens in
people the ancestral knowledge that they possess how do i find my soulmate through the
tradition of the sun that's what everyone here on earth is searching for the magus said
unwittingly echoing wicca's words perhaps they'd been taught by the same teacher
breida thought and the tradition of the sun placed in the world for everyone to see the sign that
someone is their soulmate a particular light in the eye
i've seen lots of different kinds of light in lots of people's eyes breeda said today for example i saw your
eyes shining that's what everyone looks for she's forgotten her prayer thought the magus she thinks
she's different from everyone else she's incapable of recognizing what god is generous enough to show her
i don't understand eyes she insisted tell me instead how people discover
their soulmate through the tradition of the moon the magus turned to her his eyes cold
and expressionless you're sad she said and you're sad
because i'm still incapable of learning through the simple things what you don't understand is that people
suffer they search and search for love not knowing that they're fulfilling the
divine mission of finding their soulmate you forget because you're a wise man
and don't think about what it's like for ordinary people that i carry millennia of disappointment
within me and i can no longer learn certain things through the simple things of life
the magus remained impassive a point of light he said a point of
light above the left shoulder of your soul mate that is how it is in the tradition of
the moon i have to leave she said hoping that he would ask her to stay
she liked being there he had answered her question the magus however got up and accompanied
her to the door i'm going to learn everything that you know she said i'm going to discover how to see that
point of light the magus waited until breida had gone down the stairs
there was a bus to dublin in the next half hour so there was no need for him to worry about her
then he went out into the garden and performed the ritual he performed every night he was used to doing it but sometimes he
found it hard to achieve the necessary concentration tonight he was particularly distracted
when the ritual was over he sat down on the doorstep and looked up at the sky he thought about breida he could see her
on the bus with a point of light above her left shoulder and which because she was his soul mate only he
could see he thought how eager she must be to conclude a search that had started the
day she was born he thought how cold and distant she had been when they arrived at his house
and that this was a good sign it meant she was confused about her own feelings she was defending herself from something
she couldn't understand he thought too somewhat fearfully that she was in love
everyone finds their soul mate breida he said out loud to the plants in his garden
but deep down he sensed that he too despite all his years in the tradition still needed to reinforce his faith and
that he was really talking to himself at some point in our lives we all meet
our soul mate and recognize him or her he went on if i were not a magus and couldn't see
the point of light above your left shoulder it would take a little longer for me to accept you but you would fight for me
and one day i would see the special light in your eyes however the fact is i am a magus and
it's up to me to fight for you so that all my knowledge is transformed into wisdom
he sat for a long time contemplating the night and thinking about breda traveling back to dublin on the bus
it was colder than usual summer would soon be over there are no risks in love as you'll
find out for yourself people have been searching for and finding each other for thousands of
years suddenly he realized that he might be wrong there was always a risk a single risk
that one person might meet with more than one soul mate in the same incarnation as had happened millennia before
winter and spring over the next two months wicca initiated breida into the first
mysteries of witchcraft according to her women could learn these things more quickly than men
because each month they experienced in their own bodies the complete cycle of nature birth life
and death the cycle of the moon as she called it breda had to buy a new notebook and
record in it any psychical experiences she'd had since her first meeting with wicca
the notebook always had to be kept up to date and must bear on its cover a five-pointed star which associated
everything written in it with the tradition of the moon wicca told her that all witches owned such a
book known as a book of shadows in homage to their sisters who had died during the
400 years that the witch hunt lasted why do i need to do all this we have to
awaken the gift without it you will know only the minor mysteries
the gift is your way of serving the world breida had to reserve one relatively
unused corner of her house for a kind of miniature oratory in which a candle should be kept burning
day and night the candle according to the tradition of the moon was the symbol of the four
elements and contained within itself the earth of the wick the water of the paraffin the fire that
burned and the air that allowed the fire to burn the candle was also important as a way
of reminding her that she had a mission to fulfill and that she was engaged on that mission
only the candle should be visible everything else should be hidden away on a shelf or in a drawer
from the middle ages on the tradition of the moon had demanded that witches surround their activities with absolute
secrecy for there were several prophecies warning that darkness would return at the end of the millennium
whenever brita came home and saw the candle flame she felt a strange almost sacred
responsibility wicca told her that she must always pay attention to the sound of the world
you can hear it wherever you are she said it's a noise that never stops
which is there on mountain tops in cities in the sky and at the bottom of the ocean this
noise which is like a vibration is the soul of the world transforming
itself and traveling toward the light any witch must be keenly aware of this
because she is an important part of that journey wicca also explained that the ancients
spoke to our world through symbols even if no one was listening even if the language of symbols had been forgotten
by almost everyone the ancients never ceased talking are they beings like us brida asked one day
we are them and suddenly we understand everything that we learned in our past
lives and everything that the great sages left written on the universe jesus said the kingdom of god is as if
a man should scatter seed upon the ground and should sleep and rise night and day
and the seed should sprout and grow he knows not how the human race drinks always from this
same inexhaustible fountain and even when everyone says it is doomed it still finds a way to survive
it survived when the apes drove the men from the trees and when the waters covered earth
it will survive when everyone is preparing for the final catastrophe we are responsible for the universe
because we are the universe the more time breda spent with wicca the
more aware she became of what a very pretty woman she was
wicca continued to teach breda the tradition of the moon she told her to find a two-edged dagger
with an undulating blade like a flame breda tried in various shops but there
was nothing suitable in the end lauren solved the problem by
asking a metallurgical chemistry engineer who worked at the university to make such a blade
then he himself carved a wooden handle and gave the dagger to breda as a gift
it was his way of saying that he respected her search the dagger was consecrated by wicca in a
complicated ritual involving magical words charcoal designs drawn on the blade and
a few blows with a wooden spoon the dagger was to be used as a prolongation of her own arm
keeping the energy of her body concentrated in the blade fairy godmothers used a wand for the
same purpose and magi used a sword when breida expressed her surprise
at the charcoal and the wooden spoon wicca said that in the days of witch-hunts
witches were forced to use materials that could be mistaken for ordinary everyday objects
the tradition of the dagger the charcoal and the wooden spoon had survived while the actual materials
once used by the ancients had been lost entirely brita learned how to burn incense and
how to use the dagger inside magic circles there was a ritual she had to perform whenever the moon
changed its phase she would place a cup of water on the windowsill so that the moon was
reflected in the surface then she would stand so that her own face was reflected in the water
and the moon's reflection was right in the middle of her forehead when she was completely focused she
would cut the water with a dagger causing the reflections to break up and form smaller ones
this water had to be drunk immediately and then the power of the moon would grow inside her none of this makes sense
breeda said once wicca ignored the remark for she had once thought exactly the same thing but she remembered jesus's
words about the things that grow inside each of us without our understanding how or why
it doesn't matter if it makes sense or not she told her think of the dark knight the more you do
this the more the ancients will communicate with you they will do so initially in ways you cannot understand
because only your soul will be listening but one day the voices will be heard again brita
didn't want to hear voices she wanted to find her soul mate but she said nothing of this to wicca
she was forbidden from returning to the past again according to wicca this was rarely necessary
don't use the cards to read the future either the cards are to be used only for growth without
words the kind of growth that occurs imperceptibly breeda had to spread the cards out on a
table three times a week and sit looking at them occasionally she had visions
but they were usually incomprehensible when she complained about this wikis said that the visions had a
meaning so deep that she was incapable of understanding it and why shouldn't i use the cards to
read the future only the present has power over our lives
replied wicca when you read the future in the cards you are bringing the future into the
present and that can cause serious harm the present could confuse your future
once a week they went to the wood and wicca taught her apprentice the secrets of herbs
for wicca everything in the world bore god's signature especially plants certain leaves resembled the heart and
were good for heart disease while flowers that resembled eyes could cure diseases of the eye
breda began to understand that many herbs really did bear a close resemblance to human organs
and in a book on folk medicine that lauren's borrowed from the university library she found research indicating that the
beliefs of country people and witches could well be right god placed his pharmacy in the woods and
fields wicca said one day when they were resting under a tree so that everyone could enjoy good health
breeda knew that her teacher had other apprentices but she never met them the dog always barked when her time with
wicca was up however she had passed other people on the stairs an older woman a girl about her own age and
a man in a suit brita listened discreetly to their steps until the creaking floorboards above
betrayed their destination wicca's apartment one day breeda risked asking about these
other students witchcraft is based on collective strength wicca told her
all the different gifts keep the energy of our work in constant movement each gift depends on all the others
wicca explained that there were nine gifts and that both the tradition of the sun and the tradition of the moon took care
that these gifts survived over the centuries what are the nine gifts wicca
told haraf for being lazy and asking questions all the time when a true witch should be interested
in all forms of spiritual inquiry brida she said ought to spend more time
reading the bible which contains all the true occult wisdom and to seek out the gifts in
saint paul's first epistle to the corinthians breida did so and there she found the
nine gifts the word of wisdom the word of knowledge faith healing the working of miracles
prophecy the discerning of the spirits speaking in tongues and the
interpretation of tongues it was only then that she understood the gift she was seeking
the discerning of the spirits wicca taught brita to dance she said that she
needed to learn to move her body in accordance with the sound of the world that ever-present vibration there was no
special technique it was simply a matter of making any movement that came into her head
nevertheless it took a while before breida could become used to moving and dancing in that illogical way
the magus of folk taught you about the dark knight in both traditions which are in fact one
the dark knight is the only way to grow when you set off along the path of magic
the first thing you do is surrender yourself to a greater power for you will encounter things that you will never
understand nothing will behave in the logical way you have come to expect
you will understand things only with your heart and that can be a little frightening for
a long time the journey will seem like a dark night but then any search is an act of faith
but god who is far harder to understand than a dark knight appreciates our act of faith and takes
our hand and guides us through the mystery wicca spoke of the magus with no rancor
or bitterness breda had been wrong wicca had clearly never had an affair with him
it was written in her eyes perhaps the irritation she had expressed on that first day
had merely been because they had ended up following different paths wizards and witches were vain creatures
and each wanted to prove to the other that their path was the best she suddenly realized what she had
thought she could tell wicca wasn't in love with the magus by her eyes she had seen films and read
books that talked about this the whole world could tell from someone's eyes if they were in love
i only managed to understand the simple things once i've embraced the complicated
things she thought to herself perhaps one day she would follow the tradition of the sun
it was quite late on in the year and the cold was just beginning to bite when breda received a phone call from wicca
we're going to meet in the wood in two days time on the night of the new moon just before dark
was all she said brita spent those two days thinking about that meeting
she performed the usual rituals and danced to the sound of the world i wish i could dance to some music she
thought but she was becoming used to moving her body according to that strange vibration
which she could hear better at night or in certain silent places wicca had told her that when she danced
to the sound of the world her soul would feel more comfortable in her body and there would be a lessening of
tension breda began to notice how people walking down the street didn't seem to know what to do with
their hands or how to move their hips or shoulders she felt like telling them that the
world was playing a tune and if they danced a little to that music and simply allowed their body to
move illogically for a few minutes a day they would feel much better that dance however was part of the
tradition of the moon and only witches knew about it there must be something similar in the
tradition of the sun there always was although no one appeared to want to learn it
we've lost our ability to live with the secrets of the world she said to lawrence and yet there they
are before us the reason i want to be a witch is so that i can see those secrets
on the appointed day breeda went to the wood she walked among the trees feeling the
magical presence of the spirits of nature about fifteen hundred years ago that
wood had been the sacred place of the druids until saint patrick drove the snakes from ireland
and the druid cults disappeared nevertheless respect for that place had passed from
generation to generation and even now the villagers both respected and feared it
she found wicca in the clearing wrapped in her cloak there were four other people with her
all wearing ordinary clothes and all of them women in the place where she had once noticed ashes
a fire was burning brita looked at the fire and for some reason felt afraid
she didn't know if it was because of that part of lonnie which she carried inside her or because she had known fire in her
other incarnations more women arrived some were her age and others were older than wicca
altogether there were nine i didn't invite the men today
we are here waiting for the kingdom of the moon the kingdom of the moon was the night
they stood around the fire talking about the most trivial things in the world and breida felt as if she'd
been invited to a tea party with a lot of old gossips although the setting was rather different however
as soon as the sky filled up with stars the atmosphere changed completely
wicca didn't need to call for silence gradually the conversation died
and breda wondered to herself if they'd only just noticed the presence of the fire in the forest
after a brief silence wicca spoke on this night once a year the world's
witches gather together to pray and pay homage to our forebears according to the tradition on the 10th
moon of the year we gather round a fire which was life and death to our persecuted
sisters wicca produced a wooden spoon from beneath her cloak
here is the symbol she said showing the spoon to everyone the women remained standing and held
hands then raising their joined hands they heard wicca's prayer
may the blessing of the virgin mary and of her son jesus be upon our heads tonight in our bodies
sleeps the soulmate of our ancestors may the virgin mary bless them may she
bless us because we are women and live in a world in which men love and understand us
more and more yet still we bear on our bodies the marks of past lives and those marks still hurt
may the virgin mary free us from those marks and put an end forever to our sense of
guilt we feel guilty when we go out to work because we're leaving our children
in order to earn money to feed them we feel guilty when we stay at home because it seems we're not making the
most of our freedom we feel guilty about everything because we have always been kept far from
decision making and from power may the virgin mary remind us always
that it was the women who stayed with jesus when all the men fled and denied their
faith that it was the women who wept while he carried the cross and who waited at his feet at the hour
of his death that it was the women who visited the empty tomb and that we have no reason to feel
guilty may the virgin mary remind us always that we were burned and persecuted
because we preached the religion of love when others were trying to stop time
with the power of sin we gathered together to hold forbidden festivals in which we celebrated what was still
beautiful in the world because of this we were condemned and burned in the public squares
may the virgin mary remind us always that while men were tried in the public square over land disputes
women were tried in the public square for adultery may the virgin mary remind us always of
our ancestors who like saint joan of arc had to disguise themselves as men
in order to fulfill the lord's word and yet still they died in the fire
wicca held the wooden spoon in both hands and stretched out both arms
here is the symbol of our ancestors martyrdom may the flame that devoured their bodies
remain always a light in our souls because they are in us because we are
them and she threw the spoon into the fire
brita continued to perform the rituals that wicca had taught her she kept the candle always burning and
danced to the sound of the world she noted down her meetings with wicca in the book of shadows
and went to the sacred wood twice a week she noticed to her surprise that she was
beginning to understand more about herbs and plants however the voices that wicca wanted to
awaken did not appear nor did she manage to see the point of light above anyone's left shoulder
who knows perhaps i haven't yet met my soul mate she thought rather fearfully this was
the fate of those who knew the tradition of the moon never to make a mistake when choosing
the man in their life this meant that from the moment they became a true witch they would never
again nurse the same illusions about love that other people did true this would mean less suffering or
even no suffering at all because they could love everything more intensely finding one's soulmate was
after all a divine mission in everyone's life even if one day you were forced apart
love for your soulmate according to both traditions would always be crowned with glory
understanding and a kind of purifying nostalgia it meant too that from the moment you
became able to see the point of light there would be no dark night of love
breda thought of the many times she had suffered for love the nights she had lain awake waiting for a phone call that never came
the romantic weekends that didn't survive the following week the parties spent glancing anxiously
around to see who was there the joy of making a conquest simply to prove that you could
the sadness and loneliness when you were sure that your best friend's boyfriend was the only man who could possibly make
you happy that was part of her world and the world of everyone else she knew
that was love and that was how people had searched for their soul mate since time began
by looking into another person's eyes in search of that special light desire she had never given much value to
such things on the contrary she had always thought it pointless to suffer because of someone else
or to feel scared stiff because you couldn't find anyone with whom to share your life now however that she had the chance to
free herself from such fears forever she wasn't sure she wanted to do i
really want to be able to see that point of light she thought of the magus she was
beginning to think he was right and that the tradition of the sun was the only way to deal with love but she
couldn't change her mind now she knew the path to follow and she must follow it to the end
she knew that if she gave up now she would find it harder and harder to make any choices in life
one afternoon after a long lesson devoted to rain making rituals performed by the witches of old
rituals that breda would have to note down in her book of shadows even though she would probably never use
them wicca asked if she wore all the clothes she owned no of course i don't came the reply
well from now on wear everything in your wardrobe breida thought perhaps she had
misunderstood everything that contains our energy should be in constant movement
wiki explained the clothes you bought are part of you and they represent those special times
when you left the house wanting to splash out a little because you were happy with the world
times when you'd been hurt and wanted to make yourself feel better or times when you thought you should
change your life clothes always transform emotion into matter
it's one of the bridges between the visible and the invisible some clothes can even be harmful because
they were made for someone else but have ended up in your hands breeda knew what she meant there were
some clothes she couldn't bring herself to wear because whenever she did something bad happened
get rid of any clothes that were not intended for you wicca went on and where all the others it's important
to keep the soil turned the waves crashing and all your emotions in movement
the whole universe is moving all the time and we must do likewise when she got home breda spread out the
contents of her wardrobe on the bed she looked at each item of clothing there were some she'd completely
forgotten about others brought back happy memories but were no longer fashionable
brita kept them though because they held a special charm and if she got rid of them she might be
undoing all the good things she had experienced while wearing them she looked at the clothes which she felt
contained bad vibrations she'd always hoped that those bad vibrations might one day become good
vibrations and then she would be able to wear the clothes again however whenever she put them to the test the
results were invariably disastrous she realized that her relationship with clothes was more complicated than she
had thought and yet it was hard to accept wika meddling in something as private and personal as the way she dressed
some clothes had to be kept for special occasions and only she could say when she should wear them
others weren't suitable for work or even for going out on the weekend why was wicca so interested in this she
never questioned what wicca told her to do she spent her life dancing and lighting candles plunging knives into water
and learning about rituals she would never use and she accepted all that because it was part of the tradition
a tradition she didn't understand but that was perhaps in touch with her unknown self but by meddling with her clothes wicca
was also meddling with her way of being in the world perhaps wicca had overstepped the bounds
of her power perhaps she was trying to interfere in things she shouldn't
what is outside is harder to change than what is inside
someone had said something breeda instinctively looked around her knowing that she would find no one it
was the voice the voice that wicca had wanted to awaken
she managed to curb her feelings of excitement and fear she remained silent hoping to hear
something else but there was only the noise from the street a television some way off
and the omnipresent sound of the world she tried to sit in the same position as before to think the same things as
before everything had happened so fast that she hadn't even felt frightened or surprised or proud
but the voice had said something even if everyone in the world were to prove to her that it was all just a
product of her imagination even if the witch hunts were to return and she had to stand up in court
and risk being burned to death she was utterly sure that she'd heard a voice that was
not her own what is outside is more difficult to change than what is
inside the voice could perhaps have said something a little more earth-shattering
given that this was the first time in her current incarnation that she was hearing it but suddenly breda was filled by an
intense feeling of joy she wanted to phone lauren's to go and see the magus
to tell wicca that her gift had finally been revealed and that she could now become part of the tradition of the moon
she paced the room smoked a few cigarettes and only half an hour later did she feel calm enough to sit down
again on the bed along with all her clothes the voice was right breda had
surrendered her soul to a strange woman and odd though it might seem it was far
easier to surrender her soul than her way of dressing only now was she beginning to understand
how much those apparently meaningless exercises were influencing her life only now
when she was considering changing on the outside could she realize how much she had changed
inside when they met again wicca wanted to know
all about the voice and was pleased that brida had noted down every detail in her book of shadows
whose voice is it asked breida wicca however had more important things
to do and say than answer breida's eternal questions so far i've shown you how to return to
the path that your soul traveled several incarnations ago i awoke that knowledge by speaking
directly to it with my soul through the symbols and rituals of our forebears
you might have grumbled a bit about it but your soul was glad because it was re-establishing contact
with its mission while you were getting irritated with all the exercises you had to do
feeling bored with the dancing and having to fight off sleep during rituals your hidden side was once more drinking
in the wisdom of time remembering what it had learned before and as it says in the bible
the seed was growing and sprouting although you knew not how then came the moment to start to learn
new things that is called initiation because that is where you will truly start to learn
the things you need to learn in this life the voice indicates that you are ready
in the tradition of the witches an initiation always takes place at the time of the equinox
on the two days of the year when the days and the nights are equal in length the next one is the spring equinox on
the 21st of march i would like that to be the date of your initiation because i too was initiated at the
spring equinox you know how to use the ritual instruments and you know all the rituals
that keep open the bridge between the visible and the invisible whenever you perform one of those rituals your soul recalls the lessons it
learned in past lives when you heard the voice you brought into the visible world
something that was happening in the invisible world in other words you realize that your
soul was ready for the next step you have achieved your first major objective
it occurred to breda that her original desire had been to see the point of light that would indicate her soulmate
but she had been thinking a lot lately about the search for love and that first desire was now dwindling
in importance with each week that passed there is just one test you must pass
before you can be accepted for the spring initiation if you fail don't worry you have many
equinoxes ahead of you and one day you will be initiated up until now you have dealt only with your
masculine side knowledge you know certain things and are capable of understanding what you
know but you haven't yet touched on the one great feminine force one of the great transformational powers
and knowledge without transformation is not wisdom this force has always been an accursed
power among witches in general and women in particular it is a force known to everyone on this
planet we women know that we are the great guardians of its secrets because of this force we are doomed to
wander a dangerous hostile world because we were the ones who awoke it and because there have been places where
it was considered an abomination anyone who comes into contact with this force however unknowingly
is bound to it for the rest of their life it can be your master or your slave
you can transform it into a magical force or use it all your life without ever
realizing its immense power this force is in everything around us
it's in the visible world of ordinary people and in the invisible world of the mystics it can be killed
crushed hidden even denied it can lie dormant for years forgotten
in a corner somewhere we can treat it in whichever way we want but once someone has experienced this
force he or she will never be able to forget it what force is that don't keep asking
stupid questions retorted wicca you know perfectly well what that force is yes
breeda knew sex wicca drew aside one of the immaculately
white curtains and showed breida the view the window looked out on the river
on old buildings on distant hills the magus lived somewhere over there
what's that asked wicca pointing at the top of a church steeple
across the symbol of christianity a roman would never enter a building
with a cross on it he would think it was a house of torture because the cross
represents one of the cruelest instruments of torture ever invented by man the cross might not have changed but its
meaning certainly has in the same way when mankind was closer
to god sex was the symbolic means of communion with the divine
a re-encounter with the meaning of life why do people seeking god so often
distance themselves from sex wicca was irritated by the interruption
but she answered anyway when i talk about the force i'm not talking only about the sexual act
some people make use of this force without actually having sex everything depends on which path you
take i know that force breda said i know how to make use of it
you may know about having sex with someone in bed but that isn't the same as knowing it as a force
both men and women are extremely vulnerable to the force of sex because during sex pleasure and fear
are present in equal measure why do pleasure and fear go together she had finally asked a
question worth answering because anyone who comes into contact with sex
knows that they're dealing with something which only happens in all its intensity when they lose control when we're in bed
with someone we're giving permission to that person to commune not only with our body but
also with our whole being the pure forces of life are in communication with each other
independent of us and then we cannot hide who we are it doesn't matter what image we have of
ourselves it doesn't matter what disguises we put on what smart answers or honorable excuses we give
during sex it's very difficult to deceive the other person because that is when each person shows
who they really are wicca was speaking like someone who knew this force well
her eyes were shining and there was pride in her voice perhaps that was what lay behind her
continuing attractiveness breda was glad wicca was her teacher and one day she would discover the secret of
that charm before the initiation can take place you have to experience that force
everything else belongs to the great mysteries and you will learn about that after the ceremony how do i go about
experiencing it then it's a simple enough formula and like all simple things
its results are far more complex than all the complicated rituals i taught you so far
wicca came over to breda grasped her shoulders and looked into her eyes this is the
formula use your five senses at all times
if they all come together at the moment of orgasm you will be accepted for initiation
i came to apologize brita said they were in the same place where they
had met before near the rocks on the right hand side of the mountain from where you could see the valley
below sometimes i think one thing and do another she went on but if you've ever felt love
you'll know how painful it is to suffer for love yes i know replied the magus
it was the first time he had made any comment on his private life you were right about the point of light
it's not really that important now i've discovered that the search can be as interesting as actually
finding what you're looking for as long as you can overcome your fear
that's true and breda was pleased to know that even he with all his knowledge still felt fear
they spent the afternoon walking through the snow-covered forest they talked about plants about the
landscape and about the ways in which the spiders in that region wove their webs at one point they met a shepherd leading
his sheep back home hello santiago cried the magus
then he turned to her god has a special fondness for shepherds they are people accustomed to nature
silence patience they possess all the necessary virtues to commune with the universe
up until then they hadn't discussed such matters at all and breda didn't want to anticipate the
moment she brought the conversation back to her life and to what was going on in the world
her sixth sense told her to avoid mentioning lawrence she didn't know what was going on
nor did she know why the magus was being so attentive but she needed to keep that flame alight
and a cursed power wicca had called it she had an objective and this was her
one means of attaining it they passed a few sheep whose feet left
strange prince in the snow this time there was no shepherd but the sheep seemed to know where to go
and what they were looking for the magus stood for a long time watching the sheep as if you were studying some great
secret from the tradition of the sun one that breda could not understand as
the light began to fade so did the feeling of terror and respect that always gripped her when she was
with him for the first time she felt calm and confident by his side
perhaps because she didn't need to demonstrate her gifts she had heard the voice and her entry
into the world of those other men and women was now simply a matter of time she too belonged to the path of
mysteries and from the moment that she heard the voice the man beside her had become
part of her universe she felt like grasping his hands and asking him to show her some aspect
of the tradition of the son just as she used to ask laurence to talk to her about the ancient stars
it was a way of saying that they were seeing the same thing albeit from different angles something
was telling her that he needed this and it wasn't the mysterious voice of the tradition of the moon
but the restless sometimes foolish voice of her heart a voice she didn't often listen to since
it always led her along paths she couldn't understand but emotions were indeed wild horses
and they demanded to be heard breda let them run free for a while until they grew tired
her emotions were telling her how good it would be that afternoon if she were in love with him because
when you were in love you were capable of learning everything and of knowing things you had never dared even to think
because love was the key to understanding all of the mysteries
she ran through various amorous scenarios involving the magus before she finally regained control then
she said to herself that she could never love a man like him because he understood the universe and all human
feelings looked small when viewed from a distance they reached the ruins of an old monastic church
the magus sat down on one of the many piles of carved stones scattered on the ground and breida cleared the snow off a broad
windowsill it must be good to live here spend all day in the forest
and then go home to sleep in a nice warm house she said yes it is good i know the songs of all
the different birds and i can read god's signs i've learned the traditions of the sun and the moon
but i'm alone he felt like adding and there's no point in understanding the entire universe if you're alone
there perched on the windowsill was his other half he could see the point of light above
her left shoulder and he regretted ever having learned the two traditions because had it not been for the point of
light he might not have fallen in love with her she's intelligent she sensed the danger
early and now wants to know nothing more about points of light he thought i heard the voice
wicca really is an excellent teacher it was the first time that afternoon that she'd brought up the subject of
magic the voice will teach you the mysteries of the world the mysteries that are
imprisoned in time and which are carried from generation to generation by witches
he spoke without really listening to what he was saying he was trying to remember when he had first met his soul mate
solitary people lose track of time the hours are long and the day is interminable
even so he knew they had only been together twice before breda was learning very fast
i know the rituals and i'm to be initiated into the great mysteries of the spring equinox
she was beginning to feel tense again there's one thing though that i still
haven't experienced the force that everyone knows and which they revere as if it were a
mystery the magus understood why she had come that afternoon
it wasn't just to walk among the trees and leave two sets of footprints in the snow footprints that were getting closer
every minute breeda turned up her jacket collar to protect her face
whether because the cold grew more intense when they stopped walking or because she was merely trying to
conceal her nervousness she wasn't sure i want to learn how to awaken the force of sex
through the five senses she said it last wicca won't talk about it she says that
i'll discover it just as i discovered the voice they sat for a few minutes in silence
she wondered if she should even be talking about such a thing in the ruins of a church but then she remembered that there are
many ways of using the force the monks who had lived there had worked through abstinence and they would
understand what she meant i've tried all kinds of things i think there must be a trick
like the trick with the phone to get me to really see the tarot cards i think it's something wicked doesn't
want to teach me i think she must have found it very hard to learn and wants me to experience the same difficulties
was that why you came looking for me breeda looked deep into his eyes
yes hoped her answer would convince him but she wasn't sure of anything anymore
the walk through the snowy wood the sunlight on the snow the easy conversation about the ordinary things
of the world all of this had set her emotions galloping like wild horses
she had to persuade herself again that she was there for only one reason and that she would attain her objective
by whatever means possible because god had been a woman before he became a man
the magus got up from the pile of stones he was sitting on and walked over to the only wall that
had not crumbled into rubble in the middle of the wall was a door and he stood leaning against it
the evening sun lit him from behind and breida could not see his face
there's one thing that wicked didn't teach you he said she may have forgotten to do so or she
may have wanted you to discover it alone well here i am alone
and she asked herself if perhaps this had been her teacher's plan all along to bring her together with this man
i'm going to teach you he said it last come with me
they walked to a place where the trees were taller and their trunks thicker brida noticed that some of them had
rough and ready ladders attached to the trunks at the top of each ladder was a kind of cabin
this must be where the hermits of the tradition of the sun live she thought the magus carefully examined
each cabin chose one and asked brida to join him she started to climb halfway up she felt
afraid because a fall might prove fatal nevertheless she resolved to go on
she was in a sacred place protected by the spirits of the forest the magus had not asked if she wanted to
do this but perhaps this was considered unnecessary in the tradition of the sun
when they reached the top she gave a long sigh she had conquered another of her fears
this is a good place to teach you the path he said a place of ambush ambush
these cabins are used by hunters they have to be high up so that the animals don't catch the hunter's scent
during the year the hunters leave food on the ground so that the animals get used to coming here and then one day they kill them breeda
noticed some empty cartridges on the floor she was shocked look down he said
there was barely enough space for two people and his body was almost touching hers
she did as he asked the tree must have been one of the tallest because she could see the tops of the
other trees the valley the snow-covered mountains on the horizon it was beautiful there
he needn't have said what he did about it being a place of ambush the magus pushed back the canvas roof
and suddenly the cabin was filled with sunlight it was cold and it seemed debrita that
they were in a magical place on the top of the world her emotions wanted to set off again at
a gallop but she had to keep them in check i didn't need to bring you here in order
to explain what you want to know said the magus but i wanted you to understand a little more about this
forest in the winter when both hunter and hunted are far away
i come and climb these trees and contemplate the earth he really did want to share his world
with her breda's blood began to flow more quickly she felt at peace immersed in one of
those moments in life when the only possible alternative is to lose all control
our relationships with the world come through our five senses plunging into the world of magic means
discovering other unknown senses and sex propels us toward one of those doors
he was speaking more loudly now he sounded like a teacher giving a biology lesson
perhaps it's better like this she thought although she was not convinced
it doesn't matter whether you're seeking wisdom or pleasure through the force of sex
it will always be a total experience because it's the only experience that touches or
should touch all five senses at once all our channels with the other person
are wide open at the moment of orgasm the five senses vanish and you enter the
world of magic you can no longer see hear taste touch or smell during those long seconds
everything disappears to be replaced by ecstasy it is exactly the same ecstasy as that
attained by mystics after years of renunciation and discipline
brita felt like asking why the mystics hadn't tried to attain it through orgasm
then she remembered that some were the descendants of angels what propels a person toward this
ecstasy are the five senses the more the senses are stimulated
the stronger will be the drive toward ecstasy and the more powerful the ecstasy
do you understand of course she understood she nodded but that question left her
feeling more distant she wished he were still strolling by her side through the forest
that's all there is to it i know all that but i still can't do it
breeda didn't dare mention lauren's she sensed it would be dangerous
you told me that there's a way to achieve it she was nervous and upset her emotions
were beginning to gallop out of control the magus looked down at the forest below breda wondered if he
too was struggling with his emotions but she didn't want to believe in what she was thinking nor should she she knew what the
tradition of the sun was she knew that its teachers taught through space and time
she had thought about this before she first searched him out she had imagined that they might one day
be together as they were now with no one else near that is how the teachers of the tradition of the sun
were always teaching through action and never giving theory undue importance
she had thought all this before ever coming to the forest but she had come anyway because now her
path was more important than anything else she needed to continue the tradition of her many lives
but now he was behaving like wicca who only talked about things
teach me she said the magus was staring at the bare snowy
branches he could at that moment forget he was a teacher and be merely a magus a man like any
other man he knew that his soul mate was there before him he could talk about the point
of light he could see and she would believe him and their re-encounter would be complete
even if she left in tears she would come back eventually because he was telling the truth and she
needed him as much as he needed her that was the wisdom of soul mates they always recognized each other
but he was a teacher and one day in a village in spain he had sworn a sacred oath that oath
said among other things that no teacher should ever force another person to make a choice
he had made that mistake once and because of that he had spent all those years in exile from the world
now it was different but he still didn't want to take the risk for a moment he thought i could give up
magic for her but immediately realized how foolish that thought was love didn't require that kind of
renunciation true love allowed each person to follow their own path knowing that they would never lose
touch with their soulmate he must be patient he must remember the
patience of shepherds and know that sooner or later they would be together that was the law
and he had believed in that law all his life what you're asking me is very simple he
said it last he had mastered his emotions discipline had won out
make sure that when you touch the other person all your five senses are working because
sex has a life of its own the moment you begin you're no longer in control it takes control of you and whatever you
bring to it your fears your desires your sensibility will remain that's why people become
impotent when you have sex take with you to bed only love and your senses all five of them
only then will you experience communion with god breda looked down at the cartridges on
the floor she did not betray her feelings for an instant she knew what the trick was now and that
she said to herself was all she was interested in that's all i can teach you
she did not move the wild horses were being tamed by the silence
take seven deep calm breaths and make sure all your senses are working
before there's any physical contact just let things take their course
he was a teacher of the tradition of the sun he had come through yet another test
his soulmate was also teaching him things right i've shown you the view from up
here we can go down now
she sat distractedly watching the children playing in the square someone had told her once that every
city has a magic place a place where we go when we need to think seriously about life
that square was her magic place in dublin it was near the apartment she'd rented
when she'd first arrived full of dreams and expectations her plan then had been to enroll as a
student at trinity college and eventually become a professor of literature she used to spend a lot of
time on that bench writing poetry and generally trying to behave as her literary idols had
but the money her father sent wasn't enough and she'd had to take a job at the import export company where she
worked now not that she minded she was happy with what she was doing and in fact her job was one of the most
important things in her life because it gave a sense of reality to everything and kept her from going mad
it allowed her to maintain a precarious balance between the visible world and the invisible
the children continued to play like her all of them had once been told stories
about fairies and witches about witches who dressed all in black and offered poisoned apples to poor
young girls lost in the forest none of those children could possibly imagine that a real live witch was
watching them playing now that afternoon wicca had asked her to try and exercise entirely unrelated to
the tradition of the moon an exercise useful to anyone wishing to keep open the bridge between the visible
and the invisible it was simple enough she had to lie down relax and imagine one of the main
shopping areas in the city then she had to concentrate on one particular shop window
and notice every detail of what was in the window where it was and how much each thing cost when she
had finished the exercise she had to go to the street and see if she had been right
now she was there in the square watching the children she had just come back from the shop and
the shop window had been exactly as she'd imagined it she wondered if this really was an
exercise for ordinary people or if her months of training as a witch had helped
she would never know but the shopping street she had imagined was very near to her magic place
nothing happens by chance she thought her heart was troubled over a matter she
could not resolve love she loved lauren's she was sure of that she knew that when
she was an adept in the tradition of the moon she would see the point of light above his left shoulder
one afternoon when they'd gone to a cafe together to drink a cup of hot chocolate near the tower that had inspired james
joyce's ulysses she had seen that special light in his
the magus was right the tradition of the sun was the path of all men
and it was there so that it could be deciphered by anyone who knew how to pray and be patient and who wanted to learn
what it had to teach the more she immersed herself in the tradition of the moon the more she understood and admired the
tradition of the sun the magus she was thinking about him
again this was the problem that had brought her back to her magic place
she had thought about him often since that visit to the hunter's cabin she would like to be there right now so
that she could tell him about this latest exercise but she knew that was just a pretext
what she really wanted was for him to invite her to go for a walk in the forest again
she was sure he would be pleased to see her and she was beginning to believe for some mysterious reason which she didn't
even dare to think about that he enjoyed her company too i've always had too vivid in imagination she
thought trying to get the magus out of her head but knowing that he would soon be back
she didn't want to keep thinking about him she was a woman and familiar with the symptoms of falling in love something that she had
to avoid at all costs she loved lauren's and wanted things to continue as they were
her world had changed quite enough
on saturday morning lauren's phoned let's go for a walk along the cliffs he
said brita prepared something to eat and together they endured the long journey
in an inadequately heated bus they reached the village at around midday brita felt excited
in her first year as a student of literature at the university she had read a lot about the poet who
had lived there he was a mysterious man who knew a great deal about the tradition of the moon
he had been a member of secret societies and left in his books a hidden message for those who seek the spiritual path
his name was w b yates she remembered two particular lines by him
which seemed just made for that cold morning with the seagulls flying over the boats anchored in the little harbour
i have spread my dreams under your feet tread softly because you tread on my
dreams they went into the only pub in the village drank a whiskey to keep out the
cold and then set off the little tarmac road gave way to a steep climb
and half an hour later they reached what the locals called the cliffs this was a promontory made up of rocky
outcrops that dropped sheer into the sea there was a path to follow and even at a leisurely pace they would
be able to do the whole walk in less than four hours and still catch the bus back to dublin
breta was delighted at the prospect regardless of what emotions life might be holding in reserve for her that year
she always found the winter hard to bear all she did was go to work during the day
to the university in the evening and to the cinema at weekends she dutifully performed the rituals and
dances wicca had taught her but she had a yearning to be out in the world to see a little nature
it was overcast and the clouds were very low but the physical exercise and the
whiskey helped fend off the cold the path was too narrow for them to walk along side by side
laurens went ahead and breda followed a little way behind it was hard to talk in these
circumstances nevertheless they managed to exchange a few words enough for them to feel each other close
and to enjoy the nature around them
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
she was gazing with childlike fascination at the landscape it must have been exactly the same
thousands of years ago in an age when there were no towns no harbors no poets no young women seeking the
tradition of the moon then there were only the rocks the crashing waves
and the seagulls drifting about beneath the low clouds now and then breed appeared over the
precipice and felt slightly dizzy the sea was saying things she couldn't understand
the seagulls were making patterns she couldn't follow and yet she was looking at that primitive world as if the true wisdom of
the universe lay there rather than in any of the books she'd read or in any of the rituals she
practiced as they moved away from the harbor everything else gradually diminished
in importance her dreams her daily life her search there was only what wicca called god's
signature all that remained was that primitive moment among the pure forces of nature
the sense of being alive and in the company of someone she loved
after nearly two hours of walking the path suddenly grew wider and they decided to sit down together to
rest they couldn't stop for long the cold would soon become unbearable and they would have to move on
but she felt like spending at least a few minutes by his side looking up at the clouds and listening
to the sound of the sea breda could smell the sea air and was aware of the taste of salt in her mouth
she warmed her face against lauren's jacket it was a moment of great plenitude all
five of her senses were working yes all five of her senses were working
for a fraction of a second the thought of the magus entered her mind and then vanished
all she cared about now were those five senses they must keep working this was the
moment i need to talk to you lawrence lawrence murmured something or other but his
heart was afraid as he looked up at the clouds or down at the precipice
he realized that this woman was the most important thing in his life that she was the explanation the sole
reason for the existence of those rocks that sky that winter if she were not there with him it
wouldn't matter if all the angels of heaven came flying down to comfort him paradise would make no sense i want to
tell you that i love you breeda said softly because you've shown me the joy
of love she felt full complete as if the whole landscape were
seeping into her soul he began stroking her hair and she was sure that if she took a risk
she would experience love as never before brita kissed him she felt the taste of
his mouth the touch of his tongue she was aware of every movement and sensed that he was
feeling exactly the same because the tradition of the sun always reveals itself to those who look at the
world as if they were seeing it for the first time i want to make love with you right here
laurens various thoughts flash through his mind they were on a public footpath
someone might come by some other person crazy enough to visit this place in the middle of winter
but anyone crazy enough to do so would also be able to understand that certain forces once set in motion
cannot be interrupted he slipped his hands under her sweater and stroked her breasts
breida surrendered herself entirely the forces of the world were penetrating her five senses
and these were becoming transformed into an overwhelming energy they lay down on the ground among the
rock the precipice and the sea between the life of the seagulls flying up above
and the death of the stones beneath and they began fearlessly to make love because god
protects the innocent they no longer felt the cold their blood was flowing so fast in their veins
that she tore off some of her clothes and so did he there was no more pain knees and back
were pressed into the stony ground but that became part of their pleasure completing it
breda knew that she was close to orgasm but it was still a very remote feeling because she was entirely connected to
the world her body and laurence's body mingled with the sea and the stones with life and death
she remained in that state for as long as possible while some part of her was vaguely conscious that she was doing
things she had never done before what she was feeling though was the bringing together once more of herself
and the meaning of life it was a return to the garden of eden it was the moment when eve was
reabsorbed into adam's body and the two halves became creation
at last she could no longer control the world around her her five senses seemed to break free
and she wasn't strong enough to hold on to them as if struck by a sacred bolt of lightning
she unleashed them and the world the seagulls the taste of salt the hard earth the
smell of the sea the clouds all disappeared and in their place appeared a vast
golden light which grew and grew until it touched the most distant star
in the galaxy she gradually came down from that state
and the sea and the clouds reappeared but everything was filled by a sense of profound peace
the peace of a universe that became if only for a matter of moments explicable because she was in communion
with the world she had discovered another bridge that joined the visible to the invisible
and she would never again forget the path that led to it
the following day she phoned wicca and told her what had happened for a while wicca said nothing
congratulations she said it last you've made it she explained that from
then on the power of sex would bring about profound changes in the way breida saw and experience the world
you're ready now for the celebration of the equinox there's just one more thing one more thing but you said that was it
it's quite easy you simply have to dream of a dress the dress you will wear on the day
and what if i can't you will you've done the most difficult part
and then as so often she changed the subject she told brida that she'd bought a new
car and needed to do some shopping would breeda like to go with her breeda
was proud to be invited and asked her boss if she could leave work early it was the first time wicca
had shown her any kind of affection even if it was only an invitation to join her on a shopping trip
she knew that many of wicca's other students would love to be in her shoes perhaps that afternoon would provide her
with a chance to show wicca how important she was to her and how much she wanted to be her friend
it was difficult for breda to separate friendship from the spiritual search and she was hurt because
up until then her teacher had never shown the slightest interest in her private life
their conversations never went beyond what breda needed to know in order to work within the tradition of the moon
at the appointed hour wicca was waiting outside in a red mg convertible with the top
down the car a british classic was exceptionally well preserved
with gleaming bodywork and a polished wooden dashboard breeda didn't even dare hazard a guess
at how much it must have cost the idea that a witch should own such an expensive car frightened her a little
before she'd known anything about the tradition of the moon she'd heard all kinds of tales in her childhood about
witches making terrible pacts with a devil in exchange for money and power
isn't it a bit cold to drive with the top down she asked if she got in i can't wait until summer wicca said i
just can't i've been aching to go for a drive like this for ages that was good at least in this respect
she was like any other normal person they drove through the streets receiving admiring glances from older passers-by
and a few wolf whistles and compliments from men it's a good sign that you're worried
about not being able to dream about the dress said wicca breeda however had already
forgotten about their phone conversation never stop having doubts if you ever do
it will be because you've stopped moving forward and at that point god will step in and pull the rug out from under your
feet because that is his way of controlling his chosen ones by making sure they always follow their
appointed path to the end if for any reason we stop whether out of complacency
laziness or out of a mistaken belief that we know enough he forces us on on the other hand
you must be careful never to allow doubt to paralyze you always take the decisions you need to
take even if you're not sure you're doing the right thing you'll never go wrong if when you make a
decision you keep in mind an old german proverb that the tradition of the moon has adopted
the devil is in the detail remember that proverb and you'll always be able to turn a
wrong decision into a right one wicca suddenly stopped outside a garage
there's a superstition connected to that proverb too she said it only comes to our aid when we need it
i've just bought this car and the devil is in the detail she got out as soon as a mechanic came
over to her is the hood broken madam wicca didn't even answer
she asked him to check the car over for her and while he was working the two women sat and drank hot chocolate in a
cafe across the street watch what the mechanic does wicca said
looking across at the garage he had the hood up and was standing staring at the engine not even moving
he's not touching anything he's just looking he's done this job for years
and he knows that the car speaks to him in a special language it's not his reason that's working now
it's his intuition suddenly the mechanic went straight to one particular part of the engine and
started fiddling with it he's found the fault wicca went on he didn't waste a moment
because between him and the car there is perfect communication every good mechanic i've ever known has
been the same so have the mechanics i've known thought breida
but she'd always assumed they behaved that way because they didn't know where to start she'd never noticed that they always
started in the right place if they have the wisdom of the sun in their lives
why don't they try to understand the fundamental questions of the universe why do they prefer to fix cars or work
in a bar serving coffee and what makes you think that we with
our path and our dedication understand the universe any better than other people
i have many students they're all perfectly ordinary people who cry at the movies and worry if their
children come home late even though they know that death is not the end witchcraft
is merely one way of being close to the supreme wisdom but anything you do can lead you there
as long as you work with love in your heart we witches can converse with the soul of
the world see the point of light above the left shoulder of our soul mate and contemplate the infinite through the
glow and silence of a candle but we don't understand car engines
mechanics need us as much as we need them they find their bridge across to the invisible in a car
engine while we find ours in the tradition of the moon but the bridge connects to the
same invisible world play your part and don't worry about what others do
believe that god also speaks to them and that they are as engaged as you are in discovering the meaning of life
the car's fine said the mechanic when they went back to the garage apart from a hose that was about to
burst and that could have caused you serious problems wicca haggled a little over the price
but she was very glad that she'd remembered the proverb
they went to one of dublin's main shopping streets which also happened to be the location of the shop that brita
had once had to visualize as part of an exercise whenever the conversation turned to personal topics
wicca would respond vaguely or evasively but she spoke with great verve about trivial matters
prices clothes rude shop assistance everything she bought that afternoon revealed sophistication and good taste
breda knew that it wasn't the done thing to ask someone where she got her money but so great was her curiosity that she
came very close to violating that most elementary rule of politeness they ended up in a japanese restaurant
with a dish of sashimi before them may god bless our food said wicca we are
all sailors on an unknown sea may he make us brave enough to accept this mystery
but you're a teacher of the tradition of the moon said brita you know the answers wicca sat for a
moment absorbed looking at the food then she said i know how to travel
between the present and the past i know the world of the spirits and i've communed with forces so amazing that no
words in any language could describe them i could perhaps say that i possess the
silent knowledge of the journey that has brought the human race to where it is at this moment
but because i know all this and because i am a teacher i also know that we will never ever know
the ultimate reason for our existence we might know the how where and when of being here but the why
will always be a question that remains unanswered the main objective of the great architect of the universe
is known to him alone and to no one else a silence fell right now
while we're here eating ninety-nine percent of the people on this planet are in their own way
struggling with that very question why are we here many think they've found the answer in
religion or in materialism others despair and spend their lives in their money trying to grasp the meaning
of it all a few let the question go unanswered and live for the moment regardless of the results or the
consequences only the brave and those who understand the traditions of the sun and the moon
are aware that the only possible answer to the question is i don't know
this might at first seem frightening leaving us terribly vulnerable in our dealings with the world
with the things of the world and with our own sense of our existence once we've got over that initial fear
however we gradually become accustomed to the only possible solution to follow our dreams having the courage
to take the steps we always wanted to take is the only way of showing that we trust in god
as soon as we accept this life takes on a sacred meaning and we experience the same emotion the
virgin must have felt when one afternoon in her otherwise very ordinary existence
a stranger appeared to her and made her an offer be it unto me according to thy word said
the virgin because she had understood that the greatest thing a human being can do
is to accept the mystery after another long silence
wicca again took up her knife and fork and resumed her meal breida looked at her proud to be by her
side she wasn't bothered now by the questions she would never ask about how wicca earned her money or if
she was in love with someone or jealous of someone else she thought about the greatness of soul
of the true sages sages who had spent their entire life searching for an answer that did not
exist but who were not tempted to invent an answer when they realized there was none
instead they carried on humbly inhabiting a universe they would never understand
the only way they could truly participate was by following their own desires their own dreams
because that is how man becomes an instrument of god so what's the point of looking for an
answer then we don't look for an answer we accept
and then life becomes much more intense much more brilliant because we understand that each minute
each step that we take has a meaning that goes far beyond us as individuals
we realize that somewhere in time and space this question does have an answer we realize that
there is a reason for us being here and for us that is enough we plunge into
the dark night with faith we fulfill what the ancient alchemists used to call
our personal legend and we surrender ourselves fully to each moment knowing that there
is always a hand to guide us and whether we accept it or not is entirely up to us
that night brita spent hours listening to music entirely given over to the miracle of
being alive she thought about her favorite authors one of them the english poet william blake had with
just one simple phrase given her enough faith to go in search of wisdom
what is now proved was once only imagined
it was time to perform one of her rituals she would spend the next few minutes contemplating a candle flame
and to do so she sat down before the little altar the process of contemplation took her
back to the afternoon when she and lauren's had made love among the rocks there were seagulls flying as high as
the clouds and as low as the waves the fish must have asked themselves how
they managed to fly these mysterious creatures who plunged into their world
then left as quickly as they entered the birds must have asked themselves
how the creatures they fed on and that lived beneath the waves could possibly manage to breathe
underwater birds existed and fish existed theirs were universes that occasionally
collided but they could not answer each other's questions and yet both had questions
and the questions had answers brita looked at the flame before her and
a magical atmosphere began to grow around her this was what normally happened but that
night the feeling was more intense if she were capable of asking a question
it was because in another universe there was an answer someone knew it even if she didn't
she didn't need to understand the meaning of life it was enough to find someone who did and then fall asleep in
his arms and sleep as a child sleeps knowing that someone stronger than you is protecting
you from all evil and all danger when the ritual was over she said a little prayer in gratitude
for the steps she had so far taken she was grateful because the first person she had asked about magic hadn't
tried to explain the universe to her instead he had made her spend the whole night in a dark forest
she needed to go there and thank him for all he had taught her whenever she went in search of that man
she was looking for something whenever she found that something all she did was leave
often without even saying goodbye but he had shown her the door through which she hoped to pass at the
next equinox she should at least say thank you no she wasn't afraid of falling in love
with him she had read things in laurens's eyes about the hidden side of her own soul
and while she might have her doubts about being able to dream of a dress as regards his love about that she was
perfectly clear thank you for accepting my invitation
she said to the magus when they sat down they were sitting in the only pub in the village which is where she had first
noticed the strange light in his eyes the magus said nothing he noticed that
her energy was quite different now she had clearly managed to awaken the force
on the night you left me alone in the forest i promised that i'd come back either to thank you or to curse you
i promised that i'd come back when i found my path but i didn't keep either of those promises i always came in search of help
and you never let me down it may be presumptuous of me but i want you to know that you have
acted as god's instrument and i would like you to be my guest tonight
just as she was about to order two whiskeys he got up went over to the bar and returned carrying two bottles one of
wine and one of mineral water and two glasses in ancient persia
he said when two people met to drink together one of them was chosen to be king of the
night usually the person who was paying he didn't know if his voice sounded
sufficiently steady he was a man in love and brita's energy had changed he placed the wine and the
mineral water before her it was up to the king of the night to set the tone of the conversation
if he poured more water than wine into the first glass to be drunk that meant he wished to speak of serious
things if he poured equal quantities of both they would speak of both serious and
pleasant things finally if he filled the glass with wine and added only a few drops of water
the night would be relaxing and enjoyable breeda filled the glasses to the brim
with wine and added only a drop of water to each i came to say thank you she said again
for teaching me that life is an act of faith and that i am worthy of the search that
has helped me enormously on the path i've chosen they both drained that first glass
quickly he because he was feeling tense she because she was feeling relaxed
only light subjects all right brita said the magus said that since she was the
king of the night it was up to her to decide what they should talk about i want to know a little about your
personal life i want to know if you ever had an affair with wicca
he nodded brida felt an inexplicable tremor of jealousy
but she wasn't sure whether she felt jealous of him or of wicca but we never considered living together
he said they both knew the two traditions they both knew that they were not each other's soulmate
i didn't want to learn how to see the point of light thought breida but she saw now that this was inevitable
that was what love between witches was like she drank a little more she was getting
closer to her objective it would not be long now until the spring equinox and she could afford to
relax it had been a long time since she had allowed herself to drink more than she should but now
all she had to do was dream of a dress they continued talking and drinking breda wanted to return to
the subject of wicca but she needed him to be more relaxed too she kept both their glasses filled
and they finished the first bottle while in the middle of a conversation about the difficulties of living in such a small village
the locals associated the magus with the devil breda was pleased to feel important to
him he must be very lonely maybe no one in the village ever addressed more than a few polite words
to him they opened another bottle and she was surprised to see that a magus
a man who spent all day in the forest seeking communion with god was also capable of drinking and getting
vegas said that since she was the king of the night it was up to her to decide what they should talk about
i want to know a little about your personal life i want to know if you ever had an affair
with wicca he nodded brida felt an inexplicable
tremor of jealousy but she wasn't sure whether she felt jealous of him or of wicca
but we never considered living together he said they both knew the two traditions they
both knew that they were not each other's soulmate i didn't want to learn how to see the

that was what love between witches was like she drank a little more she was getting
closer to her objective it would not be long now until the spring equinox and she could afford to

breda wanted to return to the subject of wicca but she needed him to be more relaxed too
she kept both their glasses filled and they finished the first bottle while in the middle of a conversation about the
difficulties of living in such a small village the locals associated the magus with the devil
breida was pleased to feel important to him he must be very lonely maybe no one in the village ever
addressed more than a few polite words to him they opened another bottle and she was surprised to see that a magus
a man who spent all day in the forest seeking communion with god was also capable of drinking and getting
drunk by the time they had finished the second bottle she had forgotten that she was there in order to thank the man sitting
opposite her her relationship with him she realized now had always been a veiled challenge
she didn't want to see him as an ordinary person but she was getting dangerously close to doing just that
she preferred the image of the wise man who had led her to a cabin high up in the trees
and who often spent hours contemplating the sunset she began to talk about wicca to see how
he reacted she said what an excellent teacher she was and how she had taught her
everything she needed to know so far but in such a subtle way that it was as if she'd always known the
things she was learning but you have said the magus that is the
tradition of the sun he's obviously not going to admit that wicca is a good teacher
thought brita she drank another glass of wine and continued to talk about her teacher but the magus made no further comment
tell me about you and her she said to see if she could provoke him she didn't want to know
she really didn't but it was the best way to get a reaction a case of young love we were part of a
generation that knew no limits the generation of the beatles and the rolling stones
she was surprised to hear this far from relaxing her the wine was making her tense she still
wanted to ask those questions but now she realized that she wasn't happy with the answers
that was when we met he went on unaware of her feelings we were both seeking our respective
paths and they crossed when we happened to go to the same teacher together we learned about the tradition of the sun and the tradition of the moon
and both in our own fashion became teachers brita decided to pursue the subject two
bottles of wine can make complete strangers feel as if they have been friends from childhood
wine gives people courage why did you split up it was the magus turn to order
another bottle she noticed this and grew even more tense she would hate to find out that he was
still in love with wicca we split up when we learned about soul mates
if you hadn't found out about those points of light or the special light in your soulmate's eyes would you still be
together i don't know i only know that if we were it wouldn't work for either of us we
only understand life in the universe when we find our soulmate breeda paused for a moment
suddenly lost for words it was the magus who took up the conversation
let's go he said after taking only a sip of the wine from that third bottle
i need to feel the wind and the cold air on my face he's getting drunk she thought and he's
afraid she felt proud of herself she could take her drink better than he could
and she wasn't in the least afraid of losing control she had come out that night intending to enjoy herself
just a little more after all i'm the king of the night the magus drank another glass but he
knew he had reached his limit you haven't asked me anything about myself
she said challengingly aren't you curious or can you use your powers to see right
through me for a fraction of a second she felt she had gone too far but then she dismissed the thought she
merely noticed a change in the magus eyes there was a completely different light
in them now something in breida seemed to open or rather she had the sense of a wall coming down
a feeling that from then on everything would be permitted she remembered the last time they had
been together her desire to stay with him and his coldness now she understood that
she hadn't gone there that night in order to thank him but to seek revenge
to tell him that she discovered the force with another man a man she loved why do i need
revenge why am i angry with him she wondered but the wine wouldn't allow her to
answer those questions coherently the magus was looking at the young woman
opposite him and the desire to demonstrate his power kept coming and going in his mind
on a night very like this many years ago his whole life had changed it might have been the age of the
beatles and the rolling stones but there were also people around at the time in search of unknown forces
forces they didn't even believe in they made use of magical powers while still thinking that they were stronger than
the powers themselves convinced that they'd be able to leave the tradition as soon as boredom set in
he had been one of those people he had entered the sacred world through the tradition of the moon
learning rituals and crossing the bridge that connects the visible and the invisible
at first he dabbled in these powers on his own learning from books with no help from anyone
then he met his teacher at their first meeting his teacher told him that he would be
better off learning through the tradition of the sun but the magus didn't want that the tradition of the moon was more
interesting it involved performing ancient rituals and learning the wisdom of time
and so his teacher taught him the tradition of the moon saying that perhaps this was the path
that would eventually lead him to the tradition of the sun
at the time he was utterly sure of himself of life and of his conquests a brilliant career
lay ahead of him and he intended using the tradition of the moon to achieve his goals in order to do so witchcraft
demanded that he first become a teacher and that he never infringed the one limitation placed on all teachers of the
tradition of the moon never to interfere with another person's free will
he could forge his own path in the world by using his magical knowledge but he couldn't get rid of someone
simply because they were in his way nor could he force them to follow him on his path
that was the one prohibition the only tree of whose fruit he must not eat
and everything went smoothly until he fell in love with one of his teachers other students
and she fell in love with him both knew the traditions he knew that he was not her man and she
knew that she was not his woman nevertheless they surrendered to their love leaving life in charge of
separating them when the time came far from diminishing their passion
this only made them live each moment as if it were their last and the love between them had all the
intensity of things that take on an eternal quality precisely because they're going to die
then one day she met another man this man knew nothing of the traditions
nor did he have a point of light above his left shoulder or the special light in his eyes that reveals someone to be
your soul mate love however is no respecter of reasons
and she fell in love as far as she was concerned her time with the magus had come to an
end they quarreled and fought he begged and implored
he subjected himself to all the usual humiliations endured by people in love
he learned things he never dreamed he would learn hope fear acceptance he doesn't have the
point of light above his left shoulder he argued you told me that yourself
but she didn't care before she did finally meet her soul mate she wanted to know other men to
experience the world the magus set a limit on his pain when he reached it
he would forget all about her for a reason he could now no longer remember he did reach that limit but
instead of forgetting her he discovered that his teacher was right emotions were like
wild horses and it required wisdom to be able to control them his passion was stronger than all his
years of studying the tradition of the moon stronger than all the mind control techniques he had learned
stronger than the rigid discipline to which he'd had to submit in order to get where he was
passion was a blind force and it kept whispering in his ear that he must not lose that woman
he could do nothing against her she was a teacher like him and she had learned her trade over many
incarnations some filled with fame and glory others marked by fire and suffering
she would know how to defend herself however there was a third party involved in this furious struggle
a man caught in destiny's mysterious web a web that neither magi nor witches can
understand an ordinary man perhaps as in love with that woman as he was
a man who wanted her to be happy and to do his best for her an ordinary man whom providence's
mysterious designs had thrown into the middle of this battle between a man and a woman who
knew the tradition of the moon one night when he could stand the pain no longer
he ate of the forbidden fruit using the power and knowledge that the wisdom of
time had taught him he removed that man from the woman he loved
he did not know to this day whether or not she ever found out but it may well be that she had already
grown tired of her new conquest and didn't much mind his leaving however his teacher knew
his teacher always knew everything and the tradition of the moon was implacable with those initiates who used black
magic especially to influence that most important and most vulnerable of human
emotions love when he confronted his teacher
he understood that the sacred vow he had made was impossible to break he understood that the forces he thought
he could control and use were far more powerful than he was he understood that he was on his chosen
path but that it was not a path like any other and he understood that in this incarnation he could never leave that
path now that he had heard he had to pay a price and the price was to drink that cruelest
of poisons loneliness until love felt that he had once more been transformed into a
teacher then the same love that he had wounded would set him free again
and finally reveal his soulmate to him
you haven't asked me anything about myself aren't you curious or can you use your powers to see right
through me his past took no more than a second to flash through his mind
just long enough for him to decide whether to allow things to happen as they would in the tradition of the sun or to speak to her about the point
of light and thus interfere in fate breda wanted to be a witch
but she hadn't yet achieved that ambition he remembered the cabin high up in the tree
when he had come very close to telling her now he was tempted again because having lowered his guard he had
forgotten that the devil is in the detail we are all masters of our own destiny we
can so easily make the same mistakes over and over we can so easily flee from
everything that we desire and which life so generously places before us
alternatively we can surrender ourselves to divine providence take god's hand and fight for
our dreams believing that they always arrive at the right moment let's go said the magus and breida could
see that this time he was serious she made a point of paying the bill
after all she was the king of the night they put on their coats and went out into the cold which was now less bitter
in a matter of weeks it would be spring they walked together to the bus station
a bus was due to leave in a few minutes out in the cold breida's feelings of irritation were replaced by a terrible
confusion which she could not explain she didn't want to get on that bus
everything was wrong it seemed to her that she'd entirely failed to achieve her main objective of the evening
and that she needed to put everything right before she left she had come there to thank him and yet
she was behaving just as she had on the previous two occasions she didn't get on the bus saying that
she felt sick 15 minutes passed and another bus arrived
i don't want to leave she said not because i drank too much and feel ill
but because i've spoiled everything i haven't thanked you as i should have
this is the last bus said the magus i'll get a taxi later even if it's
expensive when the bus left breeder regretted not
having got on it she was confused she had no idea what she wanted
i'm drunk she thought and said let's go for a walk i need to sober up
they strolled through the empty village with the street lamps lit and all the windows dark it's just not
possible i saw the light in lauren's eyes and yet i want to stay here with this man
she was just an ordinary fickle woman unworthy of all that she had learned and experienced through witchcraft she was
ashamed of herself all it took was a few glasses of wine and lauren's her soulmate and everything she'd
learned in the tradition of the moon were suddenly of no importance
perhaps the light in lauren's eyes wasn't the light spoken of in the tradition of the sun
but no she was merely fooling herself no one can fail to recognize the light in the eyes of their soul mate
if she were to meet lauren's in a crowded theater without ever having spoken to him before
the moment their eyes met she would know for sure that he was the man for her she would find a way of approaching him
and he would welcome her approaches because the traditions are never wrong soul mates always find each other in the
end long before she knew anything about soul mates she had often heard people speak
about that inexplicable phenomenon love at first sight any human being could recognize that
light without any need for magical powers she had known about it before she knew of its existence she had seen it for
example in the magus's eyes the first time they went to the pub together
she stopped i'm drunk she thought again she must simply forget
all about it she needed to counter money to see if she had enough for a taxi fare back that was important but she had
seen the light in the magus's eyes the light that showed he was her
soulmate you're very pale said the magus you must
have drunk too much it will pass let's sit down for a while
until it does then i'll go home they sat on a bench while she fumbled around in her bag in search of money
she could stand up find a taxi and leave forever she had a teacher and she knew how to continue her path
she knew her soulmate too if she decided to get up now and leave she would still be fulfilling the
mission god had set her she might only be 21 but she already knew it was possible to encounter two
soul mates in the same incarnation and that the result was bound to be pain and suffering how could she avoid that
i'm not going home she said i'm staying here the magus's eyes
shone and what had been only a hope became a certainty
they continued walking the magus watched breida's aura change color many times
and hoped she was taking the right path he understood the storms and earthquakes shaking the soul of his soulmate
but he knew that this was in the nature of transformations that's how the earth and the stars and
mankind are transformed they left the village and were walking out into the countryside toward the
mountains where they always met when brita asked him to stop let's go
this way she said turning down a path that led into a wheat field although why she didn't know she simply
felt a sudden need to feel the force of nature and the friendly spirits who ever since the world was created
have inhabited all the lovely places of the planet a huge moon was shining in the sky
illuminating the path and the countryside around without a word the magus followed
deep in his heart he thanked god for having believed and for not allowing him to make the
same mistake again as he had been on the point of doing just a minute before his prayers were answered
they walked through the wheat field which was transformed by the moonlight into a silver sea
breda was walking aimlessly with no idea what her next step would be a voice inside her was telling her that
she should go forward that she was just as strong as her forebears and that there was no need to
worry because they were there guiding her steps and protecting her with the wisdom of time
they stopped in the middle of the field they were surrounded by mountains and on one of those mountains was a rock
from which one could get a fine view of the sunset there was a hunter's cabin too higher up
than all the others and a place where one night a young woman had confronted fear and darkness
i'm ready she thought to herself i'm ready and i know i'm protected
she conjured up the image of the candle at home always burning her seal with the tradition of the moon
here's a good place she said stopping she picked up a twig and traced a large
circle in the earth while she recited the sacred names her teacher had taught her she didn't have a ritual dagger with her
she had none of her sacred objects but her ancestors were there and they were telling her that in order not to be
burned at the stake they had consecrated their kitchen utensils everything in this world is sacred she
said that twig was sacred yes responded the magus
everything in this world is sacred and a grain of sand can be a bridge to the invisible
at this moment though the bridge to the invisible is my soul mate breida said his eyes filled with tears
god was just the two of them entered the circle and she ritually closed it this was the
protective gesture that magi and witches had used since time immemorial you were generous enough
to show me your world said brita i perform this ritual now to show that i belong to that world
she raised her arms to the moon and invoked the magical forces of nature
she had often seen her teacher do this when they went to the wood but now she was doing it confident that
nothing would go wrong the forces were telling her that she did not need to learn anything
she had only to remember the many times she had done this in her many lives as a witch she prayed
then that the harvest would be good and that the field would always be fertile there she was
the priestess who in other ages had brought together the earth's knowledge and the transformation of the seed and
had prayed while her man was working the land the magus let brida take the initial
steps he knew that at a certain point he would have to take control but he needed to leave recorded on space
and time the fact that she had begun the process his teacher who at that moment was
wandering some astral plane awaiting his next life was there in that field of wheat just as
he had been there in the pub during his last temptation and he was doubtless happy that his student had
learned from his suffering the magus listened in silence to breeda's invocations
when she stopped she said i don't know why i have done all this but i know i have done my part i'll
continue he said then he turned to the north and imitated the cries of birds that existed
now only in myths and legends that was the only detail that had been lacking
wicca was a good teacher and had taught breeda almost everything apart from the ending when the sound of
the sacred pelican and the phoenix had been invoked the whole circle filled with light a
mysterious light which illuminated nothing around it but which was nonetheless
a light the magus looked at his soul mate and there she was resplendent in her
eternal body with a golden aura and filaments of light emerging from her navel and her
head he knew that she was seeing the same thing as well as the point of light above his left shoulder
slightly blurred perhaps because of the wine they drunk earlier
my soul mate she said softly when she saw the point of light
i am going to walk with you through the tradition of the moon said the magus and at once the wheat field around them
became a grey desert in which there was a temple with women all in white dancing before the temple's
vast door brita and the magus were watching this from high up on a dune
and she didn't know if the people could see her she felt the magus presence beside her
and wanted to ask him what the vision meant but she could not speak he saw the fear in her eyes
and they returned to the circle of light in the wheat field what was that she asked a present from
me to you that is one of the 11 secret temples of the tradition of the moon
a gift of love and gratitude for the fact that you exist and because i have waited so long to
find you take me with you she said show me how to
walk through your world and together they traveled through time and space through the two traditions
breida saw meadows full of flowers animals she had only read about in books
mysterious castles and cities that seemed to float on clouds of light the sky lit up as the magus drew for her
above the wheat field the sacred symbols of the tradition at one point they appeared to be in the icy
landscape of one of earth's two poles but it was not our planet other smaller creatures with long
fingers and strange eyes were working on a vast spaceship whenever she was about to say something
to him the images would vanish to be replaced by others breida understood with her woman's soul
that the man by her side was trying to show her everything he had learned over the years and that he must have been waiting all
this time simply to present her with this gift he could give himself to her now without
fear because she was his soul mate she could travel with him through the elysian fields
where the enlightened souls live and which are visited now and then by other souls still in search of enlightenment
so that they can nourish themselves with hope she could not have said how much time
had passed before she found herself back with that luminous being inside the circle she herself had drawn she had
known love before but until that night love had also meant fear
that fear however slight was always a veil you could see almost everything through
it but not the colors and at that moment with her soulmate there before her
she understood that love was a feeling completely bound up with color like thousands of rainbows superimposed
one on top of the other how much i missed simply because i was
afraid of missing it she thought gazing at those rainbows
she was lying down and the luminous being was on top of her with a point of light above his left
shoulder and filaments of light pouring forth from his head and his navel
i wanted to speak to you but i couldn't she said that was because of the wine he replied
the pub the wine and the feeling of irritation were now but a distant memory to breda
thank you for the visions they weren't visions said the luminous
being what you saw was the wisdom of the earth and of a distant planet
breeda didn't want to talk about that she didn't want any lessons she wanted only what she had experienced
am i full of light too yes just as i am the same color the same
light and the same beams of energy the color was golden now
and the waves of energy emerging from navel and head were a brilliant pale blue
i feel that we were lost and now are saved said breida i'm tired we should go back
i had a lot to drink too breeda knew that somewhere there existed
a world of pubs wheat fields and bus stations but she didn't want to go back there
all she wanted was to stay in that field forever she heard a distant voice making
invocations while the light around her gradually faded then vanished completely an enormous
moon lit up the sky illuminating the countryside they were naked
and in each other's arms and they felt neither cold nor shame the magus asked brita to close
the ritual since she had begun it breeda pronounced the word she knew and he helped where necessary when the
last formula had been spoken he opened the magic circle they got dressed
and sat down on the ground let's leave this place said brita after a while the magus
got up and she followed she didn't know what to say she felt awkward and so did he
they had confessed their love to each other and now like any other couple in those circumstances
they were embarrassed to look each other in the eye then the magus broke the silence you
must go back to dublin i know the number of a taxi firm breida didn't know whether to feel
disappointed or relieved the feeling of joy was giving way to nausea and a throbbing head
she was sure that she would make very bad company fine she said they turned and walked
back to the village he phoned for a taxi from a telephone booth then they sat on the curb
waiting for the cab to arrive i want to thank you for tonight she said he said nothing
i don't know if the equinox festival is just for witches but it will be a very important day for
me a party is a party then i would like to invite you
he made a gesture as if wanting to change the subject he must have been thinking the same thing she was how hard it was to leave
your soul mate once you'd found them she imagined him going home alone wondering when she would come back
she would come back because her heart was telling her to but the solitude of forests is harder to
bear than the solitude of towns i don't know if love appears suddenly
breida went on but i know that i'm open to love ready for love
the taxi came breda looked again at the magus and felt that he had grown many years
younger i'm ready for love too he said
the sunlight poured into the spacious kitchen through the sparkling clean windows did you sleep well love her mother put a
mug of tea down on the table along with some toast then she went back to the cooker where she was frying eggs
and bacon yes i did thanks by the way is my dress ready i need it for the party the day
after tomorrow her mother brought her the eggs and bacon and sat down she knew that
something odd was going on with her daughter but she could do nothing about it she would like to talk to her today as she
never had before but she would achieve little if she did there was a new world out there
a world she didn't know she was afraid for her daughter because she loved her and because breda was alone in that new
world my dress will be ready won't it mom yes by lunchtime her mother replied and
that made her happy at least some things in the world hadn't changed there were certain problems that
mothers continue to solve for their daughters she hesitated then asked how's lauren's
fine he's coming to pick me up tomorrow evening she felt simultaneously relieved and sad
problems of the heart always bruised the soul and she thanked god that her daughter had no such problems
on the other hand that was perhaps the one area on which she could advise her love having changed little over the
centuries they set off for a walk around the little village where brida had spent her
childhood the houses had remained unchanged and people were still doing the same things
they always had her daughter met a few old school friends who now worked either at the village's one bank or at the stationers
they said hello and stopped to chat some said how brita had grown others how pretty she looked around 10
o'clock they dropped in at the cafe her mother used to go to on saturdays before she met her husband in the days
when she was still hoping to meet someone and be swept up in some whirlwind romance that would put a stop to the
endless identical days she looked at her daughter again as she told her the latest news about the
various people in the village brita was still interested and this pleased her
i really do have to have the dress today breida said she seemed worried but that couldn't be
the reason she knew that her mother would never let her down her mother decided to take a
risk and ask the kind of question children always hate because they're independent free
and capable of solving their own problems is anything worrying you
have you ever been in love with two men at once mom there was a defiant note in her voice as
if life had set its traps only for her her mother took a bite of her cake a
distant look came into her eyes as she went off in search of a time that was almost lost yes i have
breida stared at her in amazement her mother smiled and invited her to continue their walk
your father was my first and greatest love she said once they'd left the cafe and i'm still
very happy with him when i was younger than you are now i had everything i could have dreamed of
at the time my friends and i believed that love was the only reason for living if you fail to find someone then you
could never claim to have realized your dreams stick to the point mom breeda was
impatient i had other dreams too though i dreamed for example of doing what you did
going off to the big city and discovering the world that lay beyond my village the only way i could get my parents to
accept my decision was by telling them that i needed to follow some course of study that wasn't
available locally the sleepless nights i spent thinking about how to broach the subject with
them i planned exactly what i was going to say and what they would say in reply and how i would answer her mother had
never spoken to her like this before breida felt a mixture of affection and regret
they could have enjoyed other such moments but they were both too caught up in their own worlds and their own values
two days before i was going to talk to my parents i met your father i looked into his eyes
and saw a special light there as if i'd met the person i most wanted to meet in the world
yes i've had the same experience after i met your father i realized too
that my search was over i didn't need any other explanation of the world
i didn't feel frustrated to be living here always seeing the same people and doing the same things
every day was different because of the great love between us we started going out together and then
we got married i never talked to him about my dreams of going to live in a big city
of discovering other places and other people because suddenly the whole world fitted into my village
love became my explanation for life you mentioned someone else mum let me
show you something her mother said in reply they walked to the bottom of the steps that led up to
the catholic church in the village and which had been destroyed and then rebuilt over the centuries
brita used to go to mass there every sunday and she remembered that as a child
climbing those steps had been really hard at the beginning of each stretch of balustrade was the carving of a saint
saint paul to the left and st james to the right rather worn by time and by tourists
the ground was covered in dry leaves as if autumn were about to arrive not spring the church was at the top of
the hill and it was impossible to see it from where they were because of the trees her mother sat down on the first step
and invited brida to do the same this is where it happened she said one
afternoon for some reason or other i decided to come here to pray i needed to be alone to think about my life
and i thought the church would be a good place to do so when i got here however i met a man he
was sitting where you are now with two suitcases beside him and he looked totally lost
desperately leafing through the book he was holding i thought he must be a tourist in search of a hotel
and so i went over to him i even started talking to him he seemed a bit startled at first but
then he relaxed he said that he wasn't lost he was an archaeologist
and had been driving north where some ruins had been found when the engine packed up a mechanic
would arrive soon and so he decided to visit the church while he waited he asked me about the village and the
other villages nearby about historic monuments suddenly
all the problems i'd been grappling with disappeared as if by magic i felt really useful and started telling
him everything i knew feeling that the many years i'd spent in the region at last had some meaning
before me was a man who had studied peoples and societies who might hold in his memory for the
benefit of future generations everything i'd heard or discovered when i was a child
that man sitting on the steps made me understand that i was important to the world
and to the history of my country i felt necessary and that's the best feeling a human
being can have when i'd finished telling him about the church we went on to talk about other
things i told him how proud i was of my village and he responded with some words by a
writer whose name i don't recall now something about how understanding your own village helps you understand the
world tolstoy said brida but her mother was still traveling in time
just as she herself had done one day except that her mother didn't require cathedrals adrift in space
subterranean libraries or dusty books she needed only the memory of that
spring afternoon and a man sitting on the steps with his suitcases
we talked for quite a while i had the whole afternoon free to spend with him but since the mechanic might arrive at
any moment i decided to make the most of every second i asked him about his world about
excavations about the challenges of spending his life looking for the past in the present
he spoke to me of the warriors wise men and pirates who had once inhabited our country
before i knew it the sun was low on the horizon and never in all my life had time passed
so quickly i sensed that he felt the same he kept asking me questions to keep the
conversation going not giving me time to say that i had to leave he talked non-stop
telling me all about his experiences and he wanted to know everything about me too
i could see in his eyes that he desired me even though at the time i was nearly twice the age you are now
it was spring there was a lovely smell of new things in the air and i felt young again there's a flower
that only blooms in the autumn well that afternoon i felt like that flower
as if suddenly in the autumn of my life when i thought i'd experienced everything i could experience
that man had appeared on the steps purely to show me that feelings love for example do not grow
old along with the body feelings form part of a world i don't know
but it's a world where there's no time no space no frontiers she remained silent for a while her eyes
were still far off fixed on that distant spring there was i like a 38 year old
adolescent feeling that someone desired me he didn't want me to leave
then all of a sudden he stopped talking he looked deep into my eyes and smiled
it was as if he'd understood with his heart what i was thinking and wanted to tell me that it was true
that i was very important to him for some time we said nothing and then we said goodbye
the mechanic had still not arrived for many days i wondered if that man really
had existed or if he was an angel sent by god to teach me the secret lessons of
life in the end i decided that he had been a real man a man who had loved me even if only for
an afternoon and during that afternoon he'd given me everything he had kept to himself
throughout his whole life his struggles his joys his difficulties and his dreams
that afternoon i gave myself holy as well i was his companion his wife his
audience his lover in a matter of only a few hours i experienced the love of a lifetime
mother looked at daughter she hoped her daughter had understood but deep down she felt that breda lived
in a world in which that kind of love had no place i've never stopped loving
your father not for a single day she concluded he's always been by my side doing his best
and i want to be with him until the end but the hearts a mysterious thing and i still don't really understand what
happened that afternoon what i do know is that meeting that man left me feeling more confident
and showed me i was still capable of loving and being loved and it taught me something else that i'll never forget
finding one important thing in your life doesn't mean you have to give up all the other important things
i still think of him sometimes i'd like to know where he is if he found what he was looking for that
afternoon if he's still alive or if god took his soul i know he'll
never come back which is why i could love him with such strength and such certainty
because i would never lose him he had given himself to me entirely that afternoon
her mother got up i better go home and finish making her dress she said i think i'll stay here for a
while breeda replied she went over to her daughter and kissed her fondly
thank you for listening to me it's the first time i've ever told anyone that story
i was always afraid i might die without having done so and that it would be wiped forever from
the face of the earth now you will keep it for me
[Music]
[Music] greeda went up the steps and stood
outside the church this small round building was the pride of the region it was one of the first places of
christian worship in ireland and every year scholars and tourists came to visit it
nothing remained of the original fifth century structure apart from some fragments of floor each
destruction however had left some part intact and so a visitor could trace the history of the
various architectural styles that made up the church inside an organ was
playing and breda stood outside for a while listening to the music everything was so clearly laid out in
that church the universe was exactly where it should be and anyone coming in through its doors
had no need to worry about anything there were no mysterious forces far above
no dark nights that called on one to believe without understanding there was no more talk of burning people
at the stake and the religions of the world live together as if they were allies binding
man once more to god her island was still an exception to that peaceful coexistence
in the north people still killed one another in the name of religion but that would eventually end god had
almost been explained away he was our generous father and we were all saved
i'm a witch she said to herself struggling against a growing impulse to enter the church
hers was now a different tradition and even if it was the same god if she walked through those doors she
would be profaning the place and would in turn be profaned she lit a cigarette and stared across at
the horizon trying not to think about these things she thought instead of her mother
she felt like running back home flinging her arms about her neck and telling her that in two days time
she was going to be initiated into the great mysteries of witchcraft that she had made journeys in time that
she had experienced the power of sex that she could guess what was in a shop window using only the techniques of the
tradition of the moon she needed love and understanding because she too
knew stories she could tell no one the organ stopped playing and bredo once again heard the voices of
the village the singing of the birds the wind stirring the branches and announcing the coming of spring
at the back of the church a door opened and closed someone had left for a moment she saw herself on a sunday
in her childhood standing where she was now feeling irritated because the mass was so long
and sunday was the only day when she was free to explore the fields i must go in perhaps her mother would
understand what she was feeling but at that moment she was far away there before
her was an empty church she had never asked wicca precisely what christianity's role had been in
everything that happened she had a sense that if she walked through that door she would be betraying
all her sisters who had been burned at the stake but then i was burned at the stake too
she said to herself she remembered the prayer wicca had said on the day commemorating the martyrdom
of the witches and in that prayer she had mentioned jesus and the virgin mary
love was above everything else and there was no hatred in love only the occasional mistake at one point
men may have decided to make themselves god's representatives and subsequently made mistakes but god
had nothing to do with that when she did finally go in there was no one else inside
a few lit candles showed that someone had taken the trouble that morning to renew their alliance
with a force they could only sense and in that way had crossed the bridge between the visible and the invisible
she regretted her thoughts before entering the church nothing was explained here either
and people had to take a chance and plunge into the dark night of faith before her arms outspread was that
seemingly simple god he could not help her she was alone with
her decisions and no one could help her she needed to learn to take risks
she didn't have the same advantages as the crucified man before her who had known what his mission was
because he was the son of god he had never made a mistake he had never known ordinary human love
only love for his father all he needed to do was to reveal his wisdom
and teach humankind the true path to heaven but was that all she remembered a sunday
catechism class when the priest had been more inspired than usual they'd been studying the
episode when jesus sweating blood was praying to god and asking him to remove the cup from which
he was being forced to drink but why if he already knew he was the
son of god asked the priest because he only knew it with his heart
if he was absolutely sure his mission would be meaningless because he would not be entirely human
being human means having doubts and yet still continuing on your path
she looked again at the image and for the first time in her entire life felt closer to it there perhaps was a
man frightened and alone facing death and asking father father why hast thou forsaken me
if he said that it was because even he wasn't sure where he was going
he had taken a chance and plunged as all men do into the dark night knowing that he
would only find the answer at the end of his journey he too had to go through the anxiety of
making decisions of leaving his father and mother in his little village to go in search of the secrets of men and
the mysteries of the law if he had been through all that then he
must have known love even though the gospels never mentioned this love between people is much more
difficult to understand than love for a supreme being but now she remembered that
when he had risen again the first person to whom he appeared was a woman who had accompanied him to the last the
silent image appeared to agree with her he had known people wine bread parties
and all the beauties of the world it was impossible that he had not also known the love of a woman
which is why he had sweated blood on the mount of olives because having known the love of one
person it was very hard to leave the earth and to sacrifice himself for the love of
all men he had experienced everything the world could offer and yet he continued on his
journey knowing that the dark knight could end on the cross or on the pyre
lord we are all in the world to run the risks of that dark night i'm afraid of death but even more afraid
of wasting my life i'm afraid of love because it involves things that are beyond our understanding
it sheds such a brilliant light but the shadow it casts frightens me
she suddenly realized that she was praying that silent simple god was looking at
her apparently understanding her words and taking them seriously for a while
she sat waiting for a response from him but heard not a sound and saw not a sign
the answer was there before her in that man nailed to the cross he had played his
part and shown to the world that if everyone played their part no one else would have to suffer because
he had suffered for all those who'd had the courage to fight for their dreams brita found herself quietly weeping
although she didn't quite know why
the day was overcast but it wasn't going to rain lawrence had lived in that city for many
years and knew its clouds he got up and went into the kitchen to make some coffee brita joined him just as the water was
boiling you came to bed very late last night he said she didn't answer today's the day
he went on and i know how important it is to you i would love to be there with you it's a
party said brita what does that mean it's a party and for as long as we've
known each other we've always gone to parties together you're invited too
the magus went out to see if the previous day's reign had damaged the bromeliads in his garden
they were fine and he smiled to himself it seemed that the forces of nature did
sometimes collaborate he thought about wicca she wouldn't be able to see the points of light
because they were visible only to the respective soul mates but she was sure to notice the energy
from the rays of light moving between him and her student witches were above all else women
the tradition of the moon described this as the vision of love and although it was something that could
happen between people who were not each other's soul mate but merely in love he imagined that it would nevertheless
fill her with anger female anger the kind felt by snow white's stepmother
who could not allow another woman to be more beautiful than she wicca however was a teacher and would
immediately realize how absurd such feelings of anger were but by then her aura would already have
changed color he would go over to her then kiss her on the cheek and say that he could see she
was jealous she would deny this and he would ask why she was angry
she would say that she was a woman and didn't need to explain her feelings he would give her another kiss on the
cheek because what she said was true and he would tell her how much he'd missed her during the time they'd been
apart and that he still admired her more than any other woman in the world with the exception of breida because
breeda was his soulmate wicca being a wise woman would feel happy then
i must be getting old he thought i'm starting to imagine conversations then it occurred to him
that it wasn't just a matter of age that was how men in love had always behaved
wicca was pleased because the rain had stopped and the clouds would clear before nightfall nature needed to be in accord with the
works of human beings she had taken all the necessary steps everyone had played their part
everything was in place she went over to the altar and invoked her teacher
she asked him to be present that night three new witches were to be initiated into the great mysteries
and she had sole responsibility for their initiation then she went into the kitchen to make
some coffee she squeezed some orange juice and ate some toast and a few crisp breads
she still took care of her appearance because she knew how pretty she was she didn't need to neglect her beauty in
order to prove that she was also intelligent and capable while she distractedly stirred her
coffee she remembered a day just like this many years before when her teacher had sealed her destiny
with the great mysteries for a moment she tried to imagine the person she had been then
what her dreams had been what she'd wanted from life i must be getting old she said out loud
sitting here thinking about the past she drank her coffee and began her preparations
there were still things to do she knew though that she wasn't getting old in her world time did not exist
breto was surprised by the number of cars parked by the roadside that morning's heavy clouds had been
replaced by a clear sky from which the last rays of the setting sun were now fading
despite the distinct chill in the air it was still the first day of spring she invoked the protection of the
spirits of the forest and then looked at lauren's he rather awkwardly repeated the same words
and yet he seemed quite happy to be there if they were to remain together they would each from time to time
have to enter the other's reality between them too there existed a bridge between the
visible and the invisible magic was present in their every act
they walked quickly through the wood and soon reached the clearing brida was prepared now for what she saw
men and women of all ages and doubtless from a wide range of professions were gathered in groups
talking and trying to make the whole event seem like the most natural thing in the world in reality though they were feeling as
perplexed as she and lauren's are all these people part of the ceremony lawrence asked
for he hadn't been expecting such a crowd breda explained that some like him were
guests she didn't know exactly who would be taking part but all would be revealed at the chosen moment
they selected a corner to put their things down including the bag lawrence was carrying
inside were breeda's dress and three bottles of wine wicca had recommended that each person
both participants and guests should bring a large bottle of wine before they left the house
lawrence had asked who the other guest was breda told him that it was the magus whom she went to visit in the mountains
and lawrence gave the matter no further thought imagine he heard a woman next to him
comment imagine what my friends would say if they knew i was at a real witch's sabbath a
witch's sabbath the celebration that had survived the spilled blood the fires the age of reason and oblivion
lorenz tried to reassure himself after all there were many other people like him there
however a shudder ran through him when he saw a pile of logs in the middle of the clearing
wicca was talking to some other people but as soon as she saw breeda she came over to say hello and to ask if
she was all right brita thanked her for her kindness and introduced lauren's
and i've invited someone else as well she said wicca looked at her surprised then
smiled broadly breda was sure she knew who she meant i'm glad
wicca said after all it's his celebration too and it's ages since i saw that old
wizard maybe he's learned a thing or two more people arrived and breda couldn't
tell who were the guests and who were the participants half an hour later when almost a hundred people
were gathered in the clearing talking quietly wicca called for silence
this is a ceremony she said but it is also a celebration and no celebration can
begin without everyone filling their glass she opened her bottle of wine and filled
the glass of the person next to her the wine was soon flowing freely and the voices grew louder
brita didn't want a drink still fresh in her memory was a field of wheat in which a man had shown her the secret
temples of the tradition of the moon besides the guest she was expecting had
still not arrived lawrence on the other hand was starting to feel much more relaxed
and it started chatting to the people around him it really is a party he said to breita
smiling he had come there expecting something extraordinary but it turned out it was just a party
and much more fun than the parties held by his fellow scientists a little way off stood a man with a
white beard whom he recognized as a professor from the university he didn't know quite what to do but
after a while the professor recognized him too and raised his glass in greeting
lawrence felt relieved witches were no longer hunted nor were there sympathizers
it's like a picnic brita heard someone say yes it was like a picnic and that made
her feel rather irritated she had expected something more ritualistic more like the sabbaths that
had inspired goya sansone and picasso she picked up the bottle beside her and began to drink
a party crossing the bridge between the visible and the invisible by means of a party
breda was intrigued to know how anything sacred could possibly happen in such a secular atmosphere
night was falling fast and people continued to drink just as darkness threatened to submerge
everything some of the men present without performing any specific ritual lit the fire that is how it had been in
the past before fire became a powerful element in the rituals of witchcraft
it had been merely a source of light a light around which women gathered to talk about their men
their magical experiences their encounters with incubi and succubi the much feared sexual demons of the
middle ages that is how it had been in the past a party a huge popular festival
a joyful celebration of spring and hope in an age when being happy was a challenge to the law
because no one could enjoy themselves in a world made only to tempt the weak the lords of the land shut up in their
dark castles gazed out at the fires in the forests and felt as if they'd been robbed
those peasants were eager for happiness and no one who has experienced happiness can ever again feel at ease with sadness
the peasants might then expect to be happy year round and that would threaten the whole political and religious system
four or five people who were already slightly tipsy began dancing around the fire perhaps in
imitation of a witch's sabbath among the dancers breida saw an initiate
whom she'd met when wicca commemorated the martyrdom of the sisters she was shocked she had assumed
followers of the tradition of the moon would behave in a way more in keeping with that sacred place
she remembered the night she had spent with the magus and how drink had hindered communication between them
during their astral travel my friends will be green with envy she
heard someone say they'll never believe i was here that was too much
she needed to get a little distance to understand properly what was going on and to resist a strong desire simply to
leave and go home before she became entirely disillusioned with everything she'd believed in for
nearly a year now she looked for wicca and saw her talking and laughing with some of the guests
the number of people dancing around the fire was growing larger all the time some were clapping and singing
accompanied by others keeping time by beating on the empty bottles with sticks or keys
i need to go for a walk she told lawrence a group of people had gathered around
him fascinated by what he was telling them about ancient stars and the miracles of
modern physics however he immediately stopped talking and asked would you like me to come with
you no i'd rather be alone she left the group and headed off into the forest
the voices were growing ever louder and more raucous and everything the drunkenness the
comments the people playing it being witches and wizards around the fire became mixed up in her head she had
waited so long for this night but it was turning out to be just another party like one of those charity
dudes where people eat get drunk tell jokes and then make speeches about the need to
help the indians in the southern hemisphere or the seals at the north pole
she began walking through the forest always keeping with inside of the fire she walked along a path that gave her a
view from above the central stone however seen from high up the view was
even more disappointing wicca was busy circulating among the different groups asking if everything
was all right people were dancing around the fire a few couples were already exchanging
their first drunken kisses lawrence was talking animatedly to two men
perhaps about things that would have been fine in the setting of a bar but not at a celebration like this a
latecomer entered the wood a stranger attracted by the noise in search of a little fun
she recognized his way of walking the magus startled brita began running back down
the path she wanted to reach him before he got to the party she needed him to help her as he had before
she needed to understand the meaning of what was going on there
wicca certainly knows how to organize a sabbath thought the magus as he approached
he could see and feel the free flow of energy among the people present at this phase of the ritual the sabbath
resembled any other party it was important to ensure that all the guests were on the same wavelength
at his first sabbath he had felt very shocked by all this he remembered calling his teacher over
and asking him what was going on haven't you ever been to a party before
his teacher had asked annoyed at the magus for interrupting an interesting conversation
of course he had the mega said and what makes for a good party
everyone enjoying themselves men have been holding parties since the days when they lived in caves
said his teacher they're the first group rituals we know of and the tradition of the son took it
upon itself to keep that ritual alive a good party cleanses the minds of all those taking part
but it's very difficult to make that happen it only takes a few people to spoil the general mood
those people think they're more important than the others they're hard to please they think they're wasting their time
because they can't make contact with anyone else and they usually end up the victims of a mysterious form of poetic justice
they tend to leave weighed down by the astral larvae given off by those people who have managed to bond with others
remember the first road to god is prayer the second is joy many years had passed
since that conversation with his teacher the magus had taken part in many sabbaths since then
and he knew that this was a very skillfully arranged example the collective energy level was growing
all the time there were a lot of people there and he
wasn't used to crowds he knew that he needed to partake of that collective energy and he was quite prepared to do so but
first he needed to reaccustom himself she could help him he would feel more at ease once he had found her
he was a magus he knew about the point of light all he needed was to alter his state of
consciousness and the point of light would appear in the midst of all those people for years he had searched for
that light and now it was there only yards away from him the magus altered his state of
consciousness he looked again at the people gathered there this time with a changed perception and
he could see a vast range of different colored auras all of them though were shifting closer to the color that would predominate that
night wicca really is an excellent teacher he thought again she works very fast soon all the auras
the energy vibrations that surround each physical body would be vibrating as one and then the
second part of the ritual could begin he looked to the right and left and
finally located the point of light he decided to surprise her and approached without a sound
breeda he said his soulmate turned around she's gone for a walk a young man said
politely for a moment that seemed to last forever the magus looked at the man standing
before him you must be the magus that brita has told me so much about
said lawrence join us she won't be long but breeda was already there she was
standing opposite the two men breathing hard eyes wide
from the other side of the fire the magus sensed someone watching he knew that look it would not be able
to see the points of light because only soulmates could recognize each other but it was a deep and ancient
look one that knew the tradition of the moon and the hearts of men and women
the magus turned and faced wicca she smiled at him from the other side of the fire
in a fraction of a second she had understood everything breda also had her eyes fixed on the
magus they were a light with pleasure he had come i'd like to introduce you to lawrence
she said the party suddenly seemed like fun and she no longer needed any explanations
the magus was still in that altered state of consciousness he saw breida's aura rapidly changing
and moving toward the color that wicca had chosen she was pleased and happy that he had come and anything he said or did could
so easily ruin her initiation that night he must at all costs control his feelings
pleased to meet you he said to lawrence how about pouring me a glass of wine
lauren smiled and held out the bottle welcome to the group he said i'm sure
you'll enjoy the party wicca looked away and gave a sigh of relief
breeda had noticed nothing she was a good student and wicca would have been loath to remove her from that night's initiation
ceremony because she had failed to take the simplest step of all by not joining in with a general good
cheer and he can take care of himself the magus had years of work and discipline
behind him he would be capable of keeping his feelings in check long enough at least to replace those feelings with something
else she respected his hard work and his stubbornness and felt slightly afraid of
his immense power she chatted with a few of the other guests but couldn't quite get over her
surprise at what she'd just seen so that was why he'd paid so much attention to breda
who was after all a witch like any other witch who had spent various incarnations
learning the tradition of the moon brida was his soul mate my feminine
intuition clearly isn't working very well she had imagined everything except that
most obvious of reasons she consoled herself by thinking that at least the result of all her curiosity
had been a positive one it was the path chosen by god to enable her to rediscover her student
the magus spotted someone he knew in the crowd and excused himself for a moment to go and speak to him
breda was euphoric enjoying his presence there beside her but she felt it best to let him leave
her feminine intuition was telling her that it was best if he and lawrence didn't spend too much time together
they might become friends and when two men are in love with the same woman it's better that they hate each other
than that they become friends because if that happened she would end up losing them both
she looked at the people around the fire and suddenly she felt like dancing too she asked laurens to join her he
hesitated for a second but then took courage and said yes people were still spinning around and
clapping drinking wine and beating out a rhythm on the empty wine bottles with sticks and keys
whenever she danced past the magus he smiled and raised his glass to her this was one of the best nights of her
life wicca joined the circle of dancers where everyone was feeling relaxed and happy
the guests who had been rather anxious about what might happen and worried about what they might see had now entered fully into the spirit of
the night spring had arrived and they needed to celebrate to fill their souls with faith in future sunlit
days and forget as quickly as possible the gray evenings and lonely nights spent at
home the clapping grew louder and now it was wicker setting the rhythm
it was an insistent regular rhythm everyone's eyes were fixed on the fire no one was cold it was
as if summer had arrived already the people around the fire began to take off their sweaters
let's sing said wicca she sang a simple two-verse song several times and soon everyone was
singing with her a few people recognized it as a witch's mantra where what mattered was the sound of the
words not the meaning it was the sound of union with the gifts and those endowed with magic vision
like the magus and the other teachers present could see the filaments of light joining various people lawrence
eventually grew bored with the dancing and went to join the musicians others moved away from the fire some
because they were tired and others because wicca had asked them to help keep the rhythm going
only the initiates noticed what was happening that the party was beginning to enter sacred territory
very soon the only people dancing around the fire were the women from the tradition of the
moon and the witches who were to be initiated that night even wicca's male students stopped
dancing the initiation ritual for the men was different and took place on a different date what
was turning and turning in the astral plane immediately above the fire was female energy the energy of
transformation so it had been since time immemorial
brita began to feel very hot it couldn't be the wine because she drunk very little
it was probably the flames from the fire she had a great desire to take off her blouse but she felt embarrassed
an embarrassment that gradually lost all meaning as she clapped and sang that simple song and danced around the fire
her eyes were now fixed on the flames and the world seemed less and less important
it was a feeling very similar to the one she'd experienced when the tarot cards had revealed themselves to her for the
first time i'm going into a trance she thought but so what
this party's fun what strange music laurens was thinking as he kept
time beating the bottle his ear trained to listen to his own body had noticed that the rhythm of the
clapping and the sound of the words vibrated exactly in the middle of his chest as happened when he heard
the bass drum in a concert of classical music the odd thing was that the rhythm also
seemed to be dictating the beating of his heart as wicca quickened the pace his heart
beat faster too the same thing must be happening to everyone more blood is flowing to my brain the
scientific part of his mind told him but he was part of a witch's ritual and
this was no time to be thinking such things he could talk to breda about it later i
it was the sound of union with the gifts and those endowed with magic vision like the magus and the other teachers

what strange music laurens was thinking as he kept time beating the bottle
his ear trained to listen to his own body had noticed that the rhythm of the clapping and the sound of the words
vibrated exactly in the middle of his chest as happened when he heard the bass drum in a concert of classical music

everyone more blood is flowing to my brain the scientific part of his mind told him
but he was part of a witch's ritual and this was no time to be thinking such things he could talk to breida about it later
i'm at a party and i want to have fun he said out loud someone beside him cried
hear hear and wicca's clapping grew a little faster i'm free i'm proud of my body because
it's the manifestation of god in the visible world cried here here and wicca's clapping
grew a little faster i'm free i'm proud of my body because
it's the manifestation of god in the visible world the heat from the fire was becoming unbearable
the world seemed far away and she no longer cared about superficial things she was alive the blood was coursing
through her veins and she was entirely given over body and soul to her search
dancing around that fire was not new to her for the rhythm awoke dormant memories of when she had been a teacher
of the wisdom of time she wasn't alone because that party was a re-encounter with herself
and with a tradition she'd carried through many lives she felt a profound respect for herself
she was once again in a body and it was a beautiful body one that had fought for millions of
years to survive in a hostile world it had lived in the sea crawled upon the earth climbed trees
walked on all fours and was now proudly standing with its two feet on the ground
that body deserved respect for its long struggle there were no beautiful or ugly bodies
because all had followed the same trajectory all were the visible part of the soul they inhabited
she felt proud deeply proud of her body she took off her blouse she wasn't
wearing a bra but that didn't matter yes she was proud of her body and no one could criticize her for that
even if she were 70 years old she would still be proud of her body because it was through her body that the
soul could do its work the other women around the fire did the same and that didn't matter either
she unbuckled the belt on her trousers and finally stood there completely naked she felt freer than at
any other time in her entire life there was no reason behind what she was doing she was doing it simply because
nakedness was the only way to show how free her soul was at that moment it didn't matter that other people were
there clothed and watching all she wished was that they could feel about their bodies as she felt about
hers she could dance freely and nothing impeded her movements every atom of her body was touching the
air and the air was generous it brought with it from afar secrets and perfumes to clothe her from
head to toe the men and the other guests beating the
wine bottles noticed that the women around the fire were naked they clapped or held hands and sang
sometimes softly and sometimes wildly no one knew who was setting the rhythm whether it was the people beating time
on the bottles the clapping or the music they all seemed aware of what was happening but if at that moment one of
them had been brave enough to break the rhythm they could not have done so at this point in the ritual
one of the teachers greatest problems was making sure that no one realized they were in a trance
they needed to feel that they were in control even though they weren't wicca was not violating the one law
which if broken was punished by the tradition with exceptional severity
manipulating the free will of others because everyone there knew they were present at a witch's
sabbath and for which is life means communion with the universe later when this night was just a memory
none of these people would tell what they had seen there was no prohibition on doing so but
they all felt they were in the presence of a powerful force a mysterious sacred force so intense and
implacable that no human being would dare to defy it turn said the woman in the black
ankle-length dress she was the only woman still fully clothed all the others were naked
as they danced and clapped and spun a man placed a pile of dresses beside her
three of them would be worn for the first time and two were very similar in style these
were people with the same gift which took material form in the dress each woman had dreamed
there was no need for wicca to clap now for the others continued to do so as if she were still keeping the beat
she knelt down pressed her thumbs to her head and began to work the power
the power of the tradition of the moon the wisdom of time was there it was a highly dangerous
power one that witches could only invoke once they had become teachers wicca knew how to use it but even so she
first asked for her teacher's protection in that power dwelled the wisdom of time
there was the serpent wise and masterful only the virgin by crushing the serpent's head beneath her
heel could subjugate it and so wicca prayed to the virgin mary as well
asking her for purity of soul steadiness of hand and the protection of her cloak so that
she could bring down that power on the women before her without it seducing or overwhelming any of them
with her face lifted to the sky her voice steady and confident she recited the words of saint paul
if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is
holy which temple ye are let no man deceive himself
if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be
wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god
for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the lord knoweth the thoughts
of the wise that they are vain therefore let no man glory in men
for all things are yours
with a few deft movements of her hand wicca slowed the rhythm of the clapping the people beating on the wine bottles
beat more slowly and the women too began to spin and turn more slowly wicca was keeping the power under
control and the whole orchestra had to work well from the loudest horn to the quietest
violin to achieve this she needed the assistance of the power but without actually surrendering to it
she clapped her hands and made the necessary noises gradually everyone stopped playing and
dancing the witches came over to wicca and picked up their dresses only three women remained naked at that
point there had been an hour and 28 minutes of continuous sound and although all those present were in a
state of altered consciousness none of them with the exception of the three naked women
had for one moment lost a sense of where they were or what they were doing
the three naked women however were still in a trance wicca held out her ritual dagger and
directed all its concentrated energy at them their gifts would soon become apparent
this was their way of serving the world having walked long and torturous paths they had finally arrived the world
had tested them in every possible way and they were worthy of what they had achieved in daily life they would
continue to have their customary weaknesses and resentments perform their usual small acts of
kindness and of cruelty the agony and the ecstasy would continue as it would for everyone who is part of
a world in a constant state of flux however at the appointed time they would
learn that each human being carries within them something far more important than their own self
namely their particular gift for god placed in the hands of each and every person a gift
the instrument he used to reveal himself to the world and to help humanity god chose human
beings to be his helpers on earth some came to understand their gift through the tradition of the sun
others through the tradition of the moon but all eventually learned what their gift was even if it took several incarnations
to do so wicca stood by the great stone placed there by the celtic priests
the witches in their black robes formed a semi-circle around her she looked at the three naked women
their eyes were shining come here the women walked into the
middle of the semi-circle wicca then asked them to lie face down on the ground with their arms
outstretched to form a cross the magus watched breida lie down on the ground
he tried to concentrate only on her aura but he was a man and a man always looks at a woman's body
he didn't want to remember he didn't want to think about whether he was suffering or not
he was aware of only one thing that his mission with his soul mate beside him was over it's a shame to have spent so
little time with her but he couldn't think like that somewhere in time they had shared the same body felt the
same pain and been made happy by the same pleasures perhaps they had walked together through a forest similar to
this and gazed up at the night sky where the same bright stars shown he smiled at the thought of his teacher
who had made him spend so long in the forest merely in order that he should understand his encounter with his soul
mate that was how things were in the tradition of the sun
each person was obliged to learn what he needed to learn and not merely what he wanted to learn
in his manheart he would weep for a long time but in his magus heart
he felt exultant and grateful to the forest wicca looked at the three women lying at
her feet and gave thanks to god that she had been able to continue doing the same work throughout so many lives
the tradition of the moon was inexhaustible the clearing in the wood had been consecrated by celtic priests
in a time now long forgotten and little remained of their rituals only perhaps the stone before which she
was standing it was a huge stone so large it could not possibly have been
transported there by human hands but then the ancients had known how to move such stones by magical means
they had built pyramids observatories and whole cities in the mountains of south america
using only the forces known to the tradition of the moon such knowledge was no longer needed by
man and had been erased from time so that it could not be turned to destructive ends
nevertheless out of pure curiosity wicca would like to have known how they had done it
there were a few celtic spirits present and she greeted them they were teachers who had ceased being
reincarnated and now formed part of earth's secret government without them without the strength of
their knowledge the planet would long since have lost its way above the trees to the left of the
clearing these celtic teachers were hovering in the air astral bodies surrounded by an intense
white light through the centuries they had come there at every equinox to make sure that the tradition was
being maintained yes said wicca with a certain pride the equinoxes continued to be celebrated
even after all celtic culture had disappeared from the official history of the world because no one can destroy the tradition
of the moon only the hand of god she observed the priests for a while longer
what would they make of people today did they feel a nostalgia for the days when they used to come to this place
and when contact with god seemed simpler and more direct wicca thought not and her instinct was
confirmed the garden of god was being constructed out of human emotions
and for this to happen people had to live a long time in different ages often adopting very
different customs as in the rest of the universe man was following his evolutionary path
and each day he was better than on the previous day even if he forgot the previous day's
lessons even if he complained claiming that life was unfair because
the kingdom of heaven is like the seed that a man plants in a field he sleeps and wakes day and night and
the seed grows even though he knows not how these lessons were engraved on the soul of the
world and existed for the benefit of all humanity it was important that there were still
people like those present at the ceremony people who were not afraid of the dark night of the soul as wise saint john of
the cross had described it each step each act of faith redeemed the
whole human race anew as long as there were people who knew that in god's eyes
all of man's wisdom was madness the world would continue along the path of light
she felt proud of her pupils male and female who had proved capable of sacrificing
the comfort of a world of nice neat explanations for the challenge of discovering a new
world she looked again at the three naked women lying on the ground
arms outstretched and tried to clothe them again in the color of the aura they emanated
they were now traveling through time and meeting many lost soul mates those
three women would from that night on plunge into the mission that had been awaiting them since they were born
one was over 60 but age was of no importance what mattered was that they were finally
face to face with the destiny that had been patiently awaiting them and from now on they would use their
gifts to keep safe certain crucial plants in god's garden each one had arrived at this place for
different reasons a failed love affair a sense of weariness with routine
or perhaps a search for power they had confronted fear inertia and the many disappointments
that assail those who follow the path of magic but the fact is they had reached the
place they needed to reach for the hand of god always guides those who follow their path with faith the tradition of the
moon is a fascinating one with its teachers and its rituals but there is another tradition too
thought the magus his eyes still fixed on breida and feeling slightly envious of wicca
who would remain by her side for a long time that other tradition was a more
difficult one to follow because it was simple and simple things always seem so complicated
its teachers lived in the world and did not always realize the importance of what they were teaching
because the impulse behind that teaching often seemed nothing more than an absurd impulse
they were carpenters poets mathematicians people from all professions and walks of
life who lived scattered throughout the world people who suddenly felt the need to
talk to someone to explain a feeling they couldn't quite understand but which was impossible to
keep to themselves and that was the way in which the tradition of the sun kept its knowledge alive the impulse of
creation wherever there were people there was always some trace of the
tradition of the sun sometimes it was a sculpture sometimes a table at others a few lines
from a poem passed from generation to generation by a particular group or tribe
the people through which the tradition of the sun spoke were people just like anyone else and
who one morning or one evening looked at the world and felt the presence of something greater
they had unwittingly plunged into an unknown sea and for the most part they did not do so
again everyone at least once in each incarnation possessed the secret of the
universe they found themselves momentarily immersed in the dark night
but lacking sufficient self-belief they rarely returned to it and the sacred heart which nourished the
world with love and peace and devotion found itself once more surrounded by thorns
wicca was glad she was a teacher of the tradition of the moon everyone who came to her was eager to
learn while in the tradition of the sun most were in permanent flight from what life was teaching them
not that it matters thought wicca because the age of miracles was returning
and no one could remain indifferent to the changes the world was beginning to experience within a few years the power of the
tradition of the sun would reveal itself in all its brilliance anyone not already following their own
path would begin to feel dissatisfied with themselves and be forced to make a choice they
would either have to accept in existence be set with disappointment in pain or else come to realize that everyone
was born to be happy having made their choice they would have no option but to change
and the great struggle the jihad would begin
with one perfect movement of her hand wicca drew a circle in the air with her dagger
inside that invisible circle she drew a five-pointed star which which is called the pentagram the
pentagram was the symbol of the elements at work in mankind and through it the women lying on the
ground would now come into contact with the world of light close your eyes said wicca the three
women obeyed above the head of each of them wicca performed the ritual moves with her
dagger now open the eyes of your souls
brida opened the eyes of her soul she was in a desert and the place looked
very familiar she remembered that she had been there before with the magus
she looked around but couldn't see him yet she wasn't afraid she felt calm and happy she knew who she
was and where she lived she knew that in some other place in time a party was going on
but none of this mattered because the landscape before her was so much prettier the sand the mountains in the distance
and a huge stone welcome said a voice beside her
stood a gentleman wearing clothes like those worn by her grandfather i am wicca's teacher when you become a
teacher your students will find wicca here and so on and so forth until the soul of the world
finally makes itself manifest i met a ritual for witches breida said a
sabbath the teacher laughed you have found your path
few people have the courage to do so they prefer to follow a path that is not their own everyone has a gift but they choose
not to see it you accept it yours and your encounter with your gift is your encounter with the world but why
so that you can plant god's garden i have a life ahead of me said brita i
want to live that life just like anyone else i want to be able to make mistakes to be selfish to have faults
the teacher smiled in his right hand a blue cloak suddenly appeared you can only be
close to people if you are one of them the scene around her changed
she was no longer in a desert but immersed in a kind of liquid in which various strange creatures were
swimming life is about making mistakes said the teacher
cells went on reproducing themselves in exactly the same way for millions of years
until one of them made a mistake and introduced change into that endless cycle of
repetition breda was gazing in amazement at the sea
she didn't understand how it was possible for them to breathe in there all she could hear was the teacher's
voice all she could think of was a very similar journey she had made and which had begun in a field of wheat
it was a mistake that set the world in motion said the teacher never be afraid of
making a mistake but adam and eve were driven out of paradise
and they will return one day knowing the miracle of the heavens and of all the world
god knew what he was doing when he drew their attention to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
if he hadn't wanted them to eat it he would never have mentioned it so why did he then
in order to set the universe in motion the scene changed back to the desert and
the stone it was morning and the horizon was becoming suffused with pink light
the teacher came toward her with a cloak i consecrate you now in this moment
your gift is god's instrument may you prove to be a useful tool
wicca picked up the dress belonging to the youngest of the three women and held it up in her two hands she made
a symbolic offering to the celtic priests who in astral form were watching everything from above the
trees then she turned to the young woman stand up she said breida stood up
the shadows from the fire flickered over her naked body once another body had been consumed by
those same flames but that time was over raise your arms
breatha raised her arms wicca put the dress on her
i was naked she said to the teacher when he had wrapped the cloak about her and i was not ashamed if it wasn't for
shame god would never have discovered that adam and eve had eaten the apple
the teacher was watching the sunrise he seemed distracted but he wasn't breda knew this never be ashamed
he said accept what life offers you and try to drink from every cup all
wines should be tasted some should only be sipped but with others drink the whole bottle
how will i know which is which by the taste you can only know a good wine if you
have first tasted a bad one wicca turned brita around to face the
fire then moved on to the next initiate the fire picked up the energy of her
gift so that it could be made manifest in her at that moment breda was watching a
sunrise a sun that would from then on light the rest of her life
now you must go said the teacher as soon as the sun had risen i'm not afraid of my gift breida told
him i know where i'm going and what i'm going to do i know that someone helped me to arrive here
i've been here before there were people dancing and a secret temple built to celebrate
the tradition of the moon the teacher said nothing he turned to her and made a sign with his right hand
you have been accepted may your path be one of peace in times of peace and of combat in times
of combat never confuse one with the other the figure of the teacher began to
dissolve along with the desert and the stone only the sun remained but the sun began
to become one with the sky then the sky grew dark and the sun became more like the flames of a fire
she was back she remembered everything now the noise the clapping the dancing the
trance she remembered having taken off her clothes in front of all these people and now she felt rather awkward but she
also remembered her meeting with a teacher she tried to master her feelings of shame and fear and anxiety
they would always be with her and she must get used to them wicca asked the three initiates to stand
in the very middle of the semicircle formed by the women the witches joined hands and made a ring
they sang songs that no one now dared to accompany the sounds flowed from their barely open
lips creating a strange vibration which grew ever shriller until it resembled the cry of some crazed bird
at some point in the future she would learn how to make those sounds she would learn many more things until
she became a teacher too then other men and women would be initiated by her into the tradition of
the moon all of this however would happen at the appointed moment
she had all the time in the world now that she had found her destiny again and had someone to help her eternity was
hers everyone appeared to have strange colors around them and breida felt slightly
bewildered she liked the world as it had been before the witches stopped singing
the initiation of the moon is finished and complete said wicca the world is now a field and
you will work to make sure that there is a good harvest i feel strange said one of the initiates
everything's blurred what you're seeing is the energy field that surrounds each
individual their aura as we call it that is the first step along the path of the great
mysteries the sensation will soon fade and later i will teach you how to awaken it again
with one swift agile movement she flung her ritual dagger to the ground
it stuck fast the handle still trembling with the force of the impact
the ceremony is over she said
breeda went over to lauren's his eyes were shining and she felt how very proud he was of
her and how much he loved her they could grow together create a new
way of living discover a whole universe that lay before them just waiting for people of
courage like them but there was another man too while she was talking to wicca's teacher
she had made her choice because that other man would be able to take her hand during difficult moments
and lead her with experience and love through the dark night of faith she would learn to love him and her love
for him would be as great as her respect they were both walking the same road to knowledge and because of him
she had reached the point where she was now with him she would one day learn the tradition of
the sun now she knew that she was a witch she had learned the art of witchcraft over
many centuries and was back where she should be from that night on
wisdom and knowledge would be the most important things in her life we can leave now she said to lawrence
he was gazing with admiration at this woman dressed all in black brida however knew that the magus would
be seeing her dressed all in blue she held out the bag containing her other clothes
you go ahead and see if you can get us a lift i need to speak to someone
lawrence took the bag but only went a little way toward the path through the forest the ritual was over and they were back
in the world of men with their loves their jealousies and their wars of conquest
fear had come back too breida was behaving oddly i don't know if god exists he said to
the trees around him and yet i can't think about that now because i too
am face to face with a mystery he felt he was talking in a different
way with a strange confidence he had never known he possessed but at that moment he believed that the
trees were listening to him the people here may not understand me
they may despise my efforts but i know that i'm as brave as they are because i
seek god even though i don't believe in him if he exists he is the god of the brave
lawrence noticed that his hands were trembling slightly the night had passed and he had
understood nothing of what went on he knew that he had entered into a trance state but that was all
however the fact that his hands were shaking had nothing to do with that plunge into the dark night as breida
called it he looked up at the sky still full of low clouds
god was the god of the brave and he would understand him because the brave are those who make
decisions despite their fear who are tormented by the devil every step of the way
and gripped by anxiety about their every action wondering if they are right or wrong and
yet nevertheless they act they do so because they also believe in miracles
like the witches who had danced around the fire that night god might be trying to return to him
through that woman who was now walking away toward another man if she left perhaps god would leave
forever she was his opportunity because she knew that the best way to immerse oneself in
god was through love he didn't want to lose the chance of getting her back
he took a deep breath feeling the cold pure air of the forest in his lungs
and he made a sacred promise to himself god was the god of the brave
brita walked over to the magus they met by the fire words came only with difficulty she was
the one to break the silence we are on the same path he nodded
so let us follow it together but you don't love me said the magus
i do love you i don't yet know my love for you but i do love you you're my soul mate
the magus still had a distant look in his eye he was thinking about the tradition of the sun
and how one of the most important lessons of the tradition of the sun was love love was the only bridge between the
visible and the invisible known to everyone it was the only effective language for translating the lessons that the
universe taught to human beings every day i'm not going anywhere she said i'm
staying with you your boyfriend is waiting replied the magus
i will bless your love breida looked at him puzzled no one can possess a sunset like
the one we saw that evening he went on just as no one can possess an afternoon of rain beating against the
window or the serenity of a sleeping child or the magical moment when the waves break
on the rocks no one can possess the beautiful things of this earth but we can know them and love them it is
through such moments that god reveals himself to mankind we are not the masters of the sun or of
the afternoon or of the waves or even of the vision of god because we cannot possess
ourselves the magus held out his hand to breeda and gave her a flower
when we first met although it seems to me that i've always known you because i can't remember the world
before that i showed you the dark knight i wanted to see how you would face up to your own
limitations i knew that you were my soul mate and that you would teach me everything i needed to learn
that is why god divided man and woman breda touched the flower it seemed to
her that it was the first flower she had seen in months spring had arrived people give flowers
as presents because flowers contain the true meaning of love anyone who tries to possess a flower
will have to watch its beauty fading but if you simply look at a flower in a field
you will keep it forever because the flower is part of the evening and the sunset and the smell of damp
earth and the clouds on the horizon brita was looking at the flower
the magus took it from her and returned it to the forest breida's eyes filled with tears she was
proud of her soul mate that is what the forest taught me that
you will never be mine and that is why i will never lose you you were my hope
during my days of loneliness my anxiety during moments of doubt my certainty during moments of faith
knowing that my soul mate would come one day i devoted myself to learning the tradition of the son
knowing that you existed was my one reason for continuing to live
breda could no longer conceal her tears then you came and i understood all of
this you came to free me from the slavery i myself had created
to tell me that i was free to return to the world and to the things of the world i understood everything i needed to know
and i love you more than all the women i have ever known more than i loved the woman who quite
unwittingly exiled me to the forest i will always remember now that love is liberty that was the lesson
it took me so many years to learn that is the lesson that sent me into exile and now
sets me free again the flames crackled in the fire and a few late comers were beginning to
say their goodbyes but breida wasn't listening to anything that was going on around her
breida she heard a distant voice call here's looking at you kid
said the magus it was a line from an old film he had seen once he felt happy because he had turned
another important page in the tradition of the sun he felt the presence of his teacher who
had chosen that night for his new initiation i will always remember you
and you will remember me just as we will remember the evening the rain on the windows and all the
things we'll always have because we cannot possess them breida lauren's called again
go in peace said the magus and dry those tears or tell him that the smoke from the fire
got in your eyes never forget me he knew he didn't need to say this
but he said it anyway wicca noticed that some people had left
a few of their belongings behind she would have to phone them and tell them to come and fetch them
the fire will have burned down soon she said he remained silent there were still a
few flames and he still had his eyes fixed on them i don't regret that i once fell in love
with you wicca went on nor do i replied the magus she felt an enormous
desire to talk about breda but she said nothing the eyes of the man beside her
inspired respect and wisdom it's a shame i'm not your soul mate
she added we would have made a good couple but the magus wasn't listening to what
wicca was saying there was a vast world before him and many things to do
he had to help plant god's garden he had to teach people to teach themselves
he would meet other women fall in love and live this incarnation as intensely as he could
that night completed one stage of his existence and a new dark knight lay ahead but the
next stage would be much more enjoyable and joyful much closer to what he had dreamed he
knew this because of the flowers and the forests and because of young women who arrive
one day led by god's hand not knowing that they are there in order for destiny to be fulfilled
he knew this because of the tradition of the moon and the tradition of the sun
