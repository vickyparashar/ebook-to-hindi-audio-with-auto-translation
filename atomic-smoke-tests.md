5. Update status to ✅ PASS once fixed

**Test Results:**
- Total Tests: 80
- Passed: 80 ✅
- Failed: 0
- Pending: 0

**All Tests Passed! 🎉**

**Working Components:**
- ✅ Server & Page Load (Flask on port 5000)
- ✅ Upload Interface (drag-drop, file chooser)
- ✅ File Upload (PDF/EPUB validation)
- ✅ PDF/EPUB Parsing (page-by-page text extraction)
- ✅ Translation (English → Hindi with caching)
- ✅ Text-to-Speech (gTTS for Hindi audio generation)
- ✅ Player UI (beautiful gradient purple design)
- ✅ Playback Controls (play/pause, next/prev, volume)
- ✅ Progress Tracking (time, page numbers, auto-advance)
- ✅ Async Processing (prefetches 3 pages ahead)
- ✅ UI/UX (responsive, loading states, error messages)
- ✅ Error Handling (graceful degradation)
