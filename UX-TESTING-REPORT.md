## 🐛 Issues Summary

### 🟡 Issue #2: Audio Plays Before Text Appears (Minor UX Issue)
**Severity:** Minor  
**Impact:** Brief user confusion (~3 seconds)  
**Reproducibility:** 100% (every first page load)  

**What Happens:**
1. User uploads file
2. Player appears with "Processing page 1..."
3. Audio starts playing (timer shows 0:09, pause button active)
4. Translated text still shows placeholder: "Translation will appear here..."
5. After 3 seconds, Hindi text finally appears
6. User briefly wonders "What is being read?"

**Root Cause:**
- `loadPage()` function in `static/js/app.js` calls `playAudio()` immediately after fetching audio path
- Translated text is fetched separately in the same request
- Race condition: audio.play() triggers before DOM updates with translated text

**Recommended Fix:**
```javascript
// In static/js/app.js - loadPage() function
// BEFORE:
playAudio();  // Called immediately after audio path fetched

// AFTER:
if (translatedText && translatedText !== 'Translation will appear here...') {
    playAudio();  // Only auto-play when text is visible
} else {
    console.log('Waiting for text to load before auto-play');
    playPauseBtn.textContent = '▶️';  // Show play button instead
}
```

**Alternative Fix:**
Add "Loading text..." indicator while audio plays, so users understand the delay

**Priority:** Medium (not breaking, but improves UX)

---

### 🟡 Issue #3: Bookshelf Modal Covers Player on Mobile (Design Decision)
**Severity:** Minor  
**Impact:** Can't see playback state while browsing books  
**Reproducibility:** 100% (on mobile viewports < 768px)  

**What Happens:**
1. User is listening to a book on mobile
2. User clicks "My Books" to browse library
3. Modal opens and takes full screen (667px height on iPhone)
4. Audio player is completely hidden behind modal
5. User can't see current book title, page number, or playback status
6. User must close modal to see what's playing

**User Story:**
> "I'm listening to page 3 of test_story.txt and want to switch to another book. I open the bookshelf, but now I can't remember which page I was on or if the audio is still playing."

**Recommended Fix - Option A (Mini-Player Header):**
```css
/* Add mini-player bar to modal header on mobile */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .modal-header {
        flex-direction: column;
    }
    
    .mini-player {
        background: rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.2);
        padding: 8px;
        border-radius: 8px;
        display: flex;
        justify-content: space-between;
        align-items: center;
        margin-top: 10px;
    }
}
```

```html
<!-- In modal header -->
<div class="mini-player">
    <span>🎧 test_story.txt - Page 1/2</span>
    <button class="pause-btn">⏸️</button>
</div>
```

**Recommended Fix - Option B (Reduce Modal Height):**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .modal-content {
        max-height: 80vh;  /* Instead of 100% */
        margin-top: auto;  /* Push to bottom */
    }
}
```
This keeps player visible at top while bookshelf slides up from bottom.

**Recommended Fix - Option C (Keep As-Is):**
Accept that users must close modal to return to player. This is standard behavior for many mobile apps.

**Priority:** Low (not breaking, just a UX enhancement idea)
