This is the first paragraph of our test story. It contains several sentences 
to make it realistic. We want to ensure that the pagination works correctly 
and creates multiple pages from this content.

This is the second paragraph. It also has multiple sentences. The smart 
pagination algorithm should handle this properly and create pages that are 
neither too large nor too small.

This is the third paragraph with even more content. We're adding enough text 
here to ensure that the pagination algorithm will create multiple pages. Each 
page should be around 200-250 words for optimal processing speed.

The fourth paragraph continues our story. By having multiple paragraphs with 
varying lengths, we can test how well the algorithm groups content together. 
The goal is fast processing without losing narrative flow.

And finally, a fifth paragraph to round things out. This should be enough 
content to create at least 2-3 pages, demonstrating that large text files 
will be automatically split into manageable chunks.
