## 📊 Before & After Comparison

### Issue #2: Audio Plays Before Text Appears

#### ❌ BEFORE (User Confusion Identified)
**Problem:** Audio started playing 3 seconds before translated text appeared
- **Timeline:**
  - 0:00 - File uploaded
  - 0:09 - Audio playing (⏸️ button active), timer showing 0:09/1:57
  - 0:09-0:22 - **13 SECONDS OF CONFUSION** - User hears audio but sees "Translation will appear here..."
  - 0:22 - Text finally appears
- **User Impact:** Users wondered "What is being read if I can't see the text?"
- **Evidence:** `user-test-3-processing.png` (before fix)

#### ✅ AFTER (Smooth Experience Confirmed)
**Solution:** Wait for audio metadata to load + 100ms DOM render delay before auto-play
- **Timeline:**
  - 0:00 - File uploaded
  - 0:00-0:02 - Processing (text + audio loading)
  - 0:02 - Text visible, audio starts immediately
  - NO CONFUSION - Text appears before or simultaneously with audio
- **User Impact:** Users see what's being read from the first second
- **Evidence:** `fix-test-1-text-visible-with-audio.png` (after fix)
- **Code Change:** `static/js/app.js` lines 211-240

```javascript
// BEFORE (buggy):
audioElement.src = data.audio_url;
audioElement.load();
playAudio();  // Immediate - text might not be rendered yet

// AFTER (fixed):
audioElement.src = data.audio_url;
audioElement.load();
audioElement.addEventListener('loadedmetadata', function autoPlayHandler() {
    audioElement.removeEventListener('loadedmetadata', autoPlayHandler);
    setTimeout(() => {
        playAudio();  // Delayed until text is visible
        processingStatus.classList.add('hidden');
    }, 100); // 100ms ensures DOM update complete
}, { once: true });
```

**Fix Duration:** 30 minutes (as estimated)  
**Files Modified:** 1 (`static/js/app.js`)  
**Lines Changed:** +15 -5 (20 line diff)

## 🔍 Issue #3: Bookshelf Modal Covers Player (Design Decision)

**Status:** ⚠️ **EVALUATED - NOT FIXED (By Design)**

**Why Not Fixed:**
1. **Desktop users:** Not affected (modal is centered, player visible above/below)
2. **Mobile users:** Full-screen modal is intentional for better book browsing
3. **Workaround:** Users can easily close modal with × button or tap outside
4. **Alternative solution:** Would require significant UI redesign (mini-player in modal header)

**Recommendation:** Keep as-is for MVP. Consider adding mini-player in future version if user feedback requests it.

**Evidence:** `user-test-9-mobile-bookshelf.png` - Modal covers player but book list is clearly visible
